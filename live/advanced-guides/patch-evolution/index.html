		<h2>Patch Evolution</h2>
    <div class="content-container">
			<p>These are the changes in the patch that specifically affect Support Zilean in some way or another.</p>
			<p>If the name is in <span class="nerf">red</span>, that means that the changes made it more difficult for Support Zilean to deal with, while items in <span class="buff">green</span> mean Zilean has a better time with said item or against an opponent.</p>
			<h3>Patch 6.3 (PBE)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/63-pbe-cycle.html" target="_blank">Tentative PBE Notes</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is one of the larger balance patchs as of late. There are many popular champions and items that are being toned down, and a few that are being buffed.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Alistar nerf</span> - Even though Zilean into Alistar is an easy matchup, taking the wind out of Alistar's healing (and the buff provided Windspeaker's Blessing).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Corki nerf</span> - Toning down the damage on Corki's Phosphorus Bomb (Q) and increasing the Missile Barrage (R) cooldown, this should make Corki a much less popular pick, but this is mostly directed to get him away from the mid lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/gragas.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Gragas buffs</span> - Gragas support is one of my favorite hidden gem supports, and now he's getting a buff (although I do not believe it was warranted). He was already pretty strong in the bottom lane as a Tank/CC support, but Zilean shouldn't have too many problems dealing with him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/graves.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Graves nerf</span> - The nerf to the base damage of Grave's End of the Line (Q) is a much needed. Graves was strong in 3 positions (Top/Jungle/ADC), but hopefully this brings him back to only the bottom lane where he is easier to contain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Kog'Maw buffs</span> - By shifting the attack speed bonus from his Q to his W, maxing W on Kog'Maw becomes much more intuitive (rather than an attack speed vs. range tradeoff). Zilean can greatly help out Kog'Maw in lane, or make his life miserable if playing against.</p>
				</li>
				<!--li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Soraka changes</span> - Oh boy, the long awaited Soraka "changes". Soraka loses a flat 50 healing off of each rank in her Heal, and gutting the potency of her self-heal when landing a Starcall (Q). She still has the global ultimate and still can heal her lane, but she is far less effective on fully sustaining a lane.</p>
				</li-->
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/boots64.png" alt="Boots of Ionian Lucidity Icon"><img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"><img src="/img/items/mobis64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p><span class="nerf">Tier 2 Boots changes</span> - These three sets of boots are being bumped up from 800g to 900g, which is a slight nerf, but nothing too impactful. This may actually be a blessing since the difference between Boots of Swiftness and other Teir 2 boots are only 200g. This may mean fewer Swifties in game, which is one item that puts a dent in how effective Zilean's slows can be.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Patch 6.2 (Jan 28- ??)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-62-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch did some balancing on a few champions, along with the nerf to the popular Frost Queen's Claim. All in all, this was not a major patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Thunderlord's Decree nerf</span> - This is yet another change to Thunderlord's, which makes the talent even less useful for Support Zilean. Right now, there are very few worthwhile final mastery talents to take as Support Zilean. Here's my <a href="/beginner-guides/mastery-breakdown/"> breakdown of the masteries.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spookies64.png" alt="Spooky Ghost Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Frost Queen's Claim nerf</span> - Since this should not be the item you go for, the increase in activation makes this much less appealing for non-supports, which means fewer Spookies in the game overall.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Tahm Kench nerf</span> - Tahm Kench took a big hit this patch to his damage and passive, but this may mean that he's going to be more prevalent in the bottom lane, in which case he will STILL be annoying at stopping all-ins.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nunu.png" alt="Nunu Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Nunu changes</span> - Nunu got a significant reduction in his snowball, but also lowered the damage. In the bottom lane, I expect him to see some play while players experiment with him, but I doubt he will be strong considering his base damage was lowered and his ratios reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/shen.png" alt="Shen Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Shen rework</span> - Shen was "reworked" this patch, and his abilities revolve around the positioning of his sword. Shen lost his ability to sustain his lane, but his taunt is unchanged, and he got a new dodge mechanic targeted around his sword that only dodges auto attacks. Shen in the bottom lane is weak, incredibly predictable and exploitable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Grail Icon"><img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p><span class="buff">Athene's Unholy Grail and Morellonomicon</span> - Both of these items got a reduction in gold, making them more cost efficient and better buys if you decide to go more AP focused.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Patch 6.1 (Jan 14 - Jan 27)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-61-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span>This was a minor patch, but did have one major benefit for Zilean, Eye of the Oasis.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Thunderlord's Decree buff</span> - The AD ratio on Thunderlord's was upped to 30% from 20%, making this a very viable choice for AD burst champions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/eye64.png" alt="Eye of the Oasis Icon">
					<p><span class="buff">Eye of the Oasis buff</span> - This is a huge change for Support Zilean because it means you can get 40% CDR from 4 items, leaving an open spot for pinks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Boots of Swiftness buff</span> - This was a change that happened early in the preseason, but pro players picked it up quickly and it became the norm. These boots reduce the effectiveness of your Slow, and many champions are taking these boots over other types.</p>
