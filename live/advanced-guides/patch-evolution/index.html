			<p>These are the changes in the patch that specifically affect Support Zilean in some way or another.</p>
			<p>If the name is in <span class="nerf">red</span>, that means that the changes made it more difficult for Support Zilean to deal with, while items in <span class="buff">green</span> mean Zilean has a better time with said item or against an opponent.</p>

			<!--h3>Patch 6.4 (Tentative PBE)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">PBE Updates</a></p-->
			<h3>Patch 6.5 (Mar 9 - ???)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.5 is a smaller patch that doesn't have too much of an impact for Support Zilean, except for the two champions below.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Change - Attack Speed Nerf</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw got his attack speed per level buffed, but removed the passive bonus from his W to compensate. This means that instead of having a massive amount of attack speed at 9 (when W was maxed), you have to continue leveling up to reach the point where it was before.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Soraka Change - Damage and Healing</p>
						<p>These changes have been in the works for some time now, and laning against Soraka before was frustrating. Now, her base heal is weaker and she is more reliant on landing her Starcall (Q) for self-sustain.</p>
						<p>With that being said, if Soraka lands her Starcall, her W heal will be even more powerful than previous patches. This means Soraka players should play more aggressively, instead of being a healbot. Soraka will likely win the trades, as the healing from her Q is really good.</p>
						<p>Personally, I like these changes and make her more dynamic to play with and against. But she is much harder to lane against now.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">PBE Updates</a></p-->
			<h3>Patch 6.4 (Feb 25 - Mar 9)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is a standard balance patch to tone down some of the strong abilities from former patches. This patch doesn't have much affecting Support Zilean.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Ashe Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ashe buff - Q - Ranger's Focus duration</p>
					<p>Ashe got a minor buff to her Q (Ranger's Focus) for a longer duration. While Ashe still isn't popular, Zilean's speed buff does help Ashe take advantage of this buff.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/caitlyn.png" alt="Caitlyn Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Caitlyn buff - Yordle Snap Trap damage</p>
						<p>Caitlyn's trap is now going to be the go-to second skill maxed (or sometimes even being maxed first) and it packs a wallop. The damage was changed around from a flat % of damage to a base value + AD ratio, making her hit even harder with lower AD.</p>
						<p>This makes it crucial that your laner has the ability to push out enough so that you don't get zoned behind a line of traps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ezreal.png" alt="Ezreal Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ezreal nerf - Trueshot Barrage cooldown</p>
					<p>This patch added an additional 50% extra cooldown on Ezreal's Ultimate, but still doesn't offer much in lowering the oppression that Ezreal has with the Iceborn Gauntlet build.</p>
					<p>Zilean is a horrible matchup with and against, so this nerf hopefully makes him less popular.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="buff">Jhin buffs - Minor laning phase buffs</p>
					<p>Pairing Zilean with Jhin is one of the strongest combos that for Jhin. The buffs on this patch are minor and are more quality of life fixes rather than deliberate buffs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw nerf - Base attack speed</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw took a flat attack speed nerf, meaning that his early lane is even harder to farm up (and less overall attack speed throughout the game).</p>
					<p>Since pairing Zilean with and against Kog'Maw is favorable, this nerf is somewhat considerable, but Kog'Maw will still have the same build and playstyle, just with a slightly lower damage output.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian nerf - Culling range decrease</p>
					<p>Lucian is another rough matchup for Zilean, and any nerfs could impact his popularity. This is a pretty substantial decrease to his ultimate range, meaning that it's easier to escape (or puts him more at risk to chase further). It is still hard to Double Bomb him out of the Culling without getting ripped apart (900 range vs. 1200 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tahm Kench nerf - Tongue Lash width decrease</p>
					<p>Tahm Kench has started to fall away from popularity, but is still strong. The difference now is that his Tongue Lash is harder to land (it's 10 units larger than a Mundo Cleaver).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="buff">Boots of Swiftness nerf - 5 Less Base Movespeed </p>
					<p>Boots of Swiftness are losing 5 base movement speed, bringing them to only 15 Movement Speed above the other boots.</p>
					<p>This is a considerable nerf, as Riot is trying to make Boots of Mobility a more appealing option for roamers, rather than having Swifties be the superior option in almost every circumstance.</p>
					<p>What does this mean for Zilean? Fewer Swifties, more potent slows. This is great because Swifties made Zilean's slows less effective, which increases the value of Zilean's kit.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mercs64.png" alt="Mercury Treads Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Mercury's Treads buff - 30% Tencacity</p>
					<p>These boots became unpopular in Season 6 because of the reduced tenacity (from 35% to 20%), but now they are being increased back up to 30.</p>
					<p>On paper, this means that champions with Merc Treads will have lower duration slows and stuns, so this will impact Zilean negatively, but likely be helpful for your own team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.3 (Feb 10 - Feb 25)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-63-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is one of the larger balance patchs as of late. There are many popular champions and items that are being toned down, and a few that are being buffed. Oh, and Duskblade.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/duskblade64.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Duskblade of Draktharr - Assassin Item</p>
					<p> This was the new assassin item introduced in patch 6.3, but it doesn't seem to be as overpowered as many believed it would be, thus it is not a super popular item.</p>
					<p>So Zilean has a leg up on most assassins normally because their burst is usually predictable and its just a matter of finding out when they are committing and hitting your ult.</p>
					<p>This makes Zilean's ult even easier to land in game because of the predictable burst is on a 2 second window (and the assassin leaving after it knows the execute is enough to finish the kill).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar nerf - Increased cooldown on Heal</p><p>Even though Zilean into Alistar is an easy matchup, taking the wind out of Alistar's healing (and the buff provided Windspeaker's Blessing).</p>
					<p>In general, Alistar is still strong, but his lane sustain was reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="buff">Corki nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>Toning down the damage on Corki's Phosphorus Bomb (Q) and increasing the Missile Barrage (R) cooldown, this should make Corki a much less popular pick, but this is mostly directed to get him away from the mid lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/gragas.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p  class="buff">Gragas buffs - W Buff (AoE damage)</p><p>Gragas support is one of my favorite hidden gem supports, and now he's getting a buff (although I do not believe it was warranted). He was already pretty strong in the bottom lane as a Tank/CC support, but Zilean shouldn't have too many problems dealing with him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/graves.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p class="buff">Graves nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>The nerf to the base damage of Grave's End of the Line (Q) is a much needed. Graves was strong in 3 positions (Top/Jungle/ADC), but hopefully this brings him back to only the bottom lane where he is easier to contain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="buff">Kog'Maw buffs - Attack speed change</p><p>By shifting the attack speed bonus from his Q to his W, maxing W on Kog'Maw becomes much more intuitive (rather than an attack speed vs. range tradeoff). Zilean can greatly help out Kog'Maw in lane, or make his life miserable if playing against.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/boots64.png" alt="Boots of Ionian Lucidity Icon"><img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"><img src="/img/items/mobis64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p><span class="nerf">Tier 2 Boots changes - Price Up</p><p>These three sets of boots are being bumped up from 800g to 900g, which is a slight nerf, but nothing too impactful. This may actually be a blessing since the difference between Boots of Swiftness and other Teir 2 boots are only 200g. This may mean fewer Swifties in game, which is one item that puts a dent in how effective Zilean's slows can be.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.2 (Jan 28- Feb 10)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-62-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch did some balancing on a few champions, along with the nerf to the popular Frost Queen's Claim. All in all, this was not a major patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Thunderlord's Decree nerf - Variable cooldown</p><p>This is yet another change to Thunderlord's, which makes the talent even less useful for Support Zilean. Right now, there are very few worthwhile final mastery talents to take as Support Zilean. Here's my <a href="/beginner-guides/mastery-breakdown/"> breakdown of the masteries.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spookies64.png" alt="Spooky Ghost Icon">
					<p class="buff">Frost Queen's Claim nerf - Longer cooldown, less slow</p><p>Since this should not be the item you go for, the increase in activation makes this much less appealing for non-supports, which means fewer Spookies in the game overall.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Tahm Kench nerf</p><p>Tahm Kench took a big hit this patch to his damage and passive, but this may mean that he's going to be more prevalent in the bottom lane, in which case he will STILL be annoying at stopping all-ins.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nunu.png" alt="Nunu Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Nunu changes - Snowball Buff</p><p>Nunu got a significant reduction in his snowball, but also lowered the damage. In the bottom lane, I expect him to see some play while players experiment with him, but I doubt he will be strong considering his base damage was lowered and his ratios reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/shen.png" alt="Shen Icon">
					<p class="buff">Shen rework - Less Sustain</p><p>Shen was "reworked" this patch, and his abilities revolve around the positioning of his sword. Shen lost his ability to sustain his lane, but his taunt is unchanged, and he got a new dodge mechanic targeted around his sword that only dodges auto attacks. Shen in the bottom lane is weak, incredibly predictable and exploitable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Grail Icon"><img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p class="buff">Athene's Unholy Grail and Morellonomicon - Price Drop</p><p>Both of these items got a reduction in gold, making them more cost efficient and better buys if you decide to go more AP focused.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-61-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span>This was a minor patch, but did have one major benefit for Zilean, Eye of the Oasis.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p class="buff">Thunderlord's Decree buff</p><p>The AD ratio on Thunderlord's was upped to 30% from 20%, making this a very viable choice for AD burst champions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/eye64.png" alt="Eye of the Oasis Icon"><img src="/img/items/watchers64.png" alt="Eye of the Watchers Icon"></div>
					<p class="buff">Eye of the Oasis/Watchers buff</p><p>This is a huge change for Support Zilean because it means you can get 40% CDR from 4 items, leaving an open spot for pinks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Boots of Swiftness buff</p><p>This was a change that happened early in the preseason, but pro players picked it up quickly and it became the norm. These boots reduce the effectiveness of your Slow, and many champions are taking these boots over other types.</p>
