				<h1>Mastery Breakdown</h1>
				<p><span>Season 6 preface: </span> Right now there isn't a single 18-point mastery that synergizes well with Support Zilean.</p>
				<p>However, there are talents in the Cunning Tree that work really well with Zilean, so Cunning is the tree that I recommend going deep into.</p>
				<p>There are only a few "mandatory" talents that I recommend, such as Meditation, Bandit, and Intelligence. The other talents are simply the best of the alternative choices.</p>
				<p>Expose Weakness in the Ferocity tree is an interesting utility talent that works well with Zilean (~6 seconds of uptime when a Double Bomb lands).</p>
				<p>This is the mastery tree that I've had great success with lately (only about 20 games tested).</p>

				<h4>Ferocity Talent Tree</h4>
				<h6>The Feroicity Tree is an offensive based tree that works better with Mid Zilean and doesn't suit the needs of a Support Zilean.</h6>
				<h6>I do not recommend taking any points in this tree, but I will go through and show the strengths of each in case you want to do some experimenting.</h6>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Fury</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fury_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer11.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Fury">
						<p>+4% Attack Speed</p></a>
					</li>

						<h4>Sorcery</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sorcery_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer12.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Sorcery"></a>
						<p>+2% increased Ability damage</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra attack speed doesn't benefit Support Zilean at all, so take the extra 2% damage from abilities. This is more beneficial for an AP mid Zilean, but can work well for a Support Zilean, especially if you are focusing more on AP and maxing Time Bomb early.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Double Edged Sword</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Double-Edged_Sword_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer111.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Double Edged Sword"></a>
						<p>Melee: Deal 3% additional damage, take 1.5% additional damage</p>
						<p>Ranged: Deal and take 2% additional damage</p>

						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Feast_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer112.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Feast"></a>
						<p>Killing a unit restores 20 Health (25 second cooldown)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Expose Weakness</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Expose_Weakness_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer113.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Expose Weakness"></a>
						<p>Your damaging abilities debuff enemies for 3 seconds, increasing the damage they take from allied champions by 3%</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Expose Weakness is the best choice of the three because Double Bombs will give about 6 seconds of the debuff (3 for when the initial bomb goes, 3 more after the second).</p>
					<p>The extra 3% damage should be fairly constant since you spam Time Bomb for zoning and stuns in teamfights.</p>
					<p>The risk vs reward for Double Edge is poor for Support Zilean, and Feast shouldn't be taken, since you shouldn't intentionally on take CS from your lane partner.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Vampirism</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vampirism_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer21.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Vampirism"></a>

						<p>+10 Attack Damage and 15 Ability Power at level 18</p>
						<p>(.55 Attack Damage and .83 Ability Power per level)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The spell vamp isn't useful for Zilean because it has reduced effect on AoE spells, so the AD/AP per level is better by default. An extra 15AP isn't a deal breaker late game, but it is far better than the alternative.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Bounty Hunter</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunter_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer211.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Bounty Hunter"></a>
						<p>Deal 1% increased damage for each unique enemy champion you have killed</p>

						<h4>Oppressor</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Oppressor_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer212.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Oppressor"></a>
						<p>Deal 2.5% increased damage to targets with impaired movement (slow, stun, root, taunt, etc.)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The Bounty Hunter can provide a max of 5% extra damage, but you may only get 2-3%. For a support, you do not want to try to take the kills, making this mastery useless.</p>
					<p>The extra damage to snared is a solid choice if you use slows in your spell combo. The extra damage will ONLY go off on the first bomb detonation unless you follow up with another slow spell at the end of the stun. Generally I take this option over Bounty Hunter because in team fights, there will be some crowd control effect on your target, so you get the bonus damage.</p>

						<p>7% Magic Penetration</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I do not recommend going this far into the tree because the final keystones are poor choices for Zilean.</p>
					<p>For this tree, the Magic Penetration is better than the Armor Penetration, but the flat penetration in Cunning is a better option overall.</p>

						<p>Basic attacks gain increasingly more life steal based on your missing health</p>

						<p>When you deal damage to an enemy, you gain a stacking buff that causes auto attacks to deal bonus damage at max stacks</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Zilean shouldn't be getting enough auto attacks to reliably use this talent, so this is pointless.</p>
						</div>

					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Deathfire Touch</h4>
						<a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Deathfire_Touch_(Season_2016_Mastery)" target="_blank"><img src="/img/masteries/fer313.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Fury"></a>
						<p>Your spells cause enemy champions to take magic damage equal to 20% of your Ability Power, halved for Area of Effect spells</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Of all the keystones in this tree, this is the best choice, although it isn't a very good one.</p>
							<p>Since Time Bomb is your only damaging spell and deals 50% less Deathfire Touch damage, it is better to just go the Thunderlord's Decree route and get either of the better Tier 3 talents in that tree.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra 3% movespeed out of combat is a solid choice for early game. Once you have Time Warp maxed out, this becomes less important, but it is still the better alternative than Feast.</p>
					<p>The extra damage to minions in lane isn't worth taking since your ADC should be getting all of the farm anyways. You could take this if you plan on shoving lanes quickly or are laning w/ a Jhin and need to help him farm.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Having the stronger potions is the best option in lane because it nets and extra 35 health that helps you sustain through the rough early game.</p>
					<p>Having the extra duration on the buff is better for a mid-laner, although I'd probably still take the stronger potions for mid-lane.</p>
					<p>Assassin is useless because you shouldn't be dueling anyone to begin with.</p>

						<p>Regenerate 1.5% of your missing Mana every 5 seconds</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The mana regen is probably the best talent to take a Support Zilean in the entire mastery list. When you build more mana, you get an even greater effect from this talent. This is huge when you buy a Tear of the Goddess early, which solves most of Zilean's mana problems.</p>
					<p>Near the end of the game, your mana pool will be well over 2000 mana, and even at half mana, you'll be getting at least 15 mana per 5, and even more the lower your mana is. This helps Zilean use his bombs for scouting and zoning, and be liberal with the use of Time Warp.</p>
					<p>The extra damage just isn't as valuable with Zilean's kit.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Bandit</h4>

						<p>Champion kills and assists restore 5% of your missing Health and Mana</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>As a support, the default go-to is Bandit because it increases the passive gold generation and rewards for harassing in lane.</p>
					<p>The health/mana restoration on kill can be the saving grace in some situations, but Zilean's ultimate is far better insurance policy than Dangerous Game.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">

						<p>Your Cooldown Reduction cap is increased to 45% and you gain 5% Cooldown Reduction</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I prefer the extra 5% CDR because it has the highest value for Zilean in terms of spell rotations. Being able to get off as many double Time Bomb combos is the goal. To see just how much of a difference the extra 5% makes throughout the game, visit the <a href="/advanced-guides/cdr-and-you/" target="_blank">CDR and You Guide.</a></p>
					<p>The flat armor/magic penetration has been argued as the better alternative to the Ferocity's percentage based tier 3 choice, but Precision is slated to be nerfed in the future. On almost any other champion, this would be the choice talent, but I value the extra CDR over more damage per spell.</p>

							<p>As Support Zilean, you won't reliably have the chance to burst out an enemy unless you are building AP early and maxing Time Bomb. This is a much better choice for the mid lane.</p>

						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Out of all of the keystone masteries, this is the most useful of the bunch. Landing 3 consecutive spells/attacks adds a minor amount of damage.</p>
							<p>This is most useful in laning when you can land a Double Bomb combo and throw an auto attack to proc the Thunderlords.</p>
							<p>As the game progresses, this mastert becomes weaker and weaker (due to AP being limited and mis-positioning being less forgiving).</p>

							<p>If this mastery was changed to give the bonus to ANY buff given (or they just included movespeed bonus), this would be the best choice.</p>

					<p>The health regen is better for Zilean in lane because as you auto attack the enemy, the minions WILL attack you back and deal a considerable amount of damage. This helps you bounce back from that deficit.</p>
					<p>The extra Armor/MR isn't worth it because Zilean typically builds only 1 moderate resist item of each type. I do recommend picking up a Zeke's Harbinger and an item that builds out of Chalice, the extra 5% adds up to an extra 1-2 Armor and MR.</p>

				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I prefer the extra MS in the river and brush because it makes escapes much easier. This movement speed is added onto the base movement speed, so you get a higher scaling Time Warp in the river. I like the utility of this talent over the minuscule damage reduction.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 fewer damage from champions adds up over time, but each auto attack from an ADC will hit deal 50-60 damage, so you'll be taking a 25+ auto attacks negating enough damage from that first auto attack. This talent works better for supports with higher armor or if you are going against a heavy poke lane.</p>

				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra 45HP is the best choice for me. This is an early game talent (in which Zilean is weakest). If you are running HP seals or quints, this will put you over 600HP going to lane, which is good for a more passive support.</p>
					<p>The only benefit from the Runic Armor is the extra 8% increase to your regeneration and health from Ancient Coin. This is such a small amount that it isn't worth it. You gain an extra 0.1 hp regen per 2 seconds in lane and a 0.9 hp regen when using a potion.</p>

						<p>+50% Base Health Regen, increased to +200% when below 25%  Health</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The lower cooldown on Summoner Spells is the most common choice in this tree, for good reason. For example, if you are tracking your opponents summoner spells by their default values (300sec / 5 minute Flash/Teleport, 240sec / 4 minute Geal, 210 / 3.5minute Exhaust/Ignite), you may be off by 30 seconds on a flash timing (255sec / 4.25minute Flash/TP, 204sec / 3.4 minute Heal, 179sec / 3 minute Exhaust/Ignite). Also having these spells more readily available makes more opportunities to engage/prevent plays.</p>
					<p>The extra health regen is not a bad talent at all, it's just better for those who expect to be staying in lane for long periods of time at a lower health. Since Support Zilean has decent sustain if you go with the Ancient Coin and three potions, this mastery is a bit unnecessary for him.</p>

						<p>+3 Armor and Magic Resist for each nearby enemy champion</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra tenacity is a nice thought, but Zilean is supposed to be elusive and able to run away before those hard CC spells land. Often this is useful in the early game while Zilean gets the levels and items needed to leave an impact in the game.</p>
					<p>The bonus to defenses when enemies are around is not a good thing for Zilean, as he shouldn't be anywhere near the enemy team's core. At most, you will have 3 people diving in, which only grants you 9 armor/mr in a position where you shouldn't be. Ultimately, this talent is best for champions who engage, and Zilean does best counter-engaging and creating picks. </p>

						<p>Every 4 seconds in combat your next attack against enemy champions deals and steals 1.5% of your max Health</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>The auto attacks stealing 9-12 health seems alright, but the damage you take from the creeps attacking you back is not worth the small amount of life stolen. Plus you have to actively be in combat to use this, which turns off your passive for 10 seconds.</p>
							<p>In the late game, you shouldn't be able to get free auto attacks outside of picking off an enemy straggler.</p>

						<p>When a Siege minion dies nearby, you gain a permanent 20 health (up to 300) and heal for 6% max health</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>This is one of the mastery choices that is starting to be popular on tanky supports, and the third best option for Support Zilean.</p>
							<p>You pick up a free 10 HP for helping start the game with a leash, and gain 20 hp every 1.5 minutes, pending you manage your backs properly. Even though you may roam and miss Siege minions, the waves gradually produce a Seige every other wave (and every wave after 35 minutes), which means that reaching the bonus 300HP is guaranteed if the game goes long enough.</p>
							<p>The downside to this is that this pick is a bit selfish if you are in the Resolve tree, and elect to not take the flat % damage reduction and the damage share with carries.</p>

						<p>+4% Damage Reduction.</p>
						<p>6% of the damage taken by the nearest allied champion is dealt to you instead</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>This is the second best keystone talents for Support Zilean across trees, this is the second best option. You will almost always have a 4% damage reduction, and help out your lane partner by soaking some of his damage.</p>
							<p>Depending on how aggressive your enemy laners are, you may even want to take this over Thunderlord's and the extra CDR.</p>
