				<h1>Laning Matchups</h1>
				<p>Laning is one of the toughest aspects when learning Support Zilean. There are two main playstyles: reactive and aggressive, and both depend on how you decide to skill your ranks.</p>
				<h3>Laning Parity</h3>
				<p>Laning parity is the mirroring of the type of support you are playing against. If you are in a lane that has lots of poke, you want to max Time Bomb over Time Warp. If you are playing against a lane that wants to all-in, you want to max Time Warp over Time Bomb.</p>
				<p>For example, if you are against an Alistar, you want to max Time Warp so if he gets out of position, your marksman can poke him down (ultimately stopping the all-in because he is afraid of dying in lane).</p>
				<p>An example of when to max Time Bomb is when you are against a poke lane or a sustain lane, such as Soraka or Janna. By throwing out more damage, you have a stronger trades, force the support to expend more mana, and can dish out some strong poke that may force one of them to leave lane early.</p>
				<h3>Laning Mindset: Reactive</h3>
				<p>When you are maxing Time Warp, Zilean's lane phase is his weakest point in the game. If you fall too far behind, you can ruin your ability to control the game.</p>
				<p>The best mindset coming into lane is "Survive the Lane, Win the Game". It is OK to play passive and react to plays, as long as you aren't dying or losing a large amount of CS. Zilean lanes will always have the XP advantage if both lanes are equal in time spend in lane.</p>
				<h3>Laning Mindset: Aggressive</h3>
				<p>When you are maxing Time Bomb, you are looking to land as many bombs on the enemy as possible, while still being able to avoid incoming damage from spells, autos, and minions.</p>
				<p>By lowering the HP of your opponent, you force them to play more cautiously and have less pressure in lane, and should force the hand of the jungler. Zilean has plenty to deal with junglers, so other lanes can get further ahead and have knowledge of where the enemy jungle should be focusing.</p>
				<h3>Laning Power Spikes</h3>
				<p><span>Level 2:</span> This is when you can first use your Double Bomb. If you push in the lane and hit 2 first, you can do some serious damage and force out a potion from the enemy ADC. This should cause that player to play more defensive.</p>
				<p><span>Level 5:</span> If you are maxing Time Bomb, this is when your Time Bomb gets a huge spike in damage (from 115 dmg up to 165). At the early stages of the game, this is some serious damage with 2 Bombs going off.<br>If you are maxing Time Warp, you get a 70% slow on the enemy. This drops the enemy movement to half of what your ADC is at, which means you will be able to get off extra autos, or force a flash. Do this especially if the enemy support roams after the 1st buy.</p>
				<p><span>Level 6:</span> This is when your ultimate is unlocked, and is a huge defensive tool. This enables solid dives, or gives your ADC the chance to be fearless and go all-in on the enemy ADC without fear of death. Zilean's ultimate has a duration of 5 seconds, which gives more than enough time to deal some extreme damage (or escape).</p>

			<h4>What does and doesn't lane well with Support Zilean</h4>
			<p>Zilean has an interesting kit which allows him to play two distinct playstyles depending on the match-up: A heavy poke damage lane, or a heavy crowd control lane where you usually have an extra member to follow up on damage.</p>
			<p>
			<div class="tier-box tier-1">

				</div>
				<p>These champions are the best pairing with Zilean for two factors:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>1) Marksmen who lack mobility</li>
						<li>2) Marksmen that can root or follow up to crowd control</li>
					</ol>
				<p>Many of these champions have a distinct weakness or flaw, and Zilean can help shield against that weakness. For example, Vayne needs help with positioning and is prone to all-in dives. But by having Zilean ult, you can make them waste spells trying to kill the Marksman as the team cleans up the tanks.</p>
				<p>Generally, maxing Time Warp is more favorable than Time Bomb, but you want to make that decision based on what lane you are going against.</p>

				<p>This group is the majority of Marksmen, who all work well with Zilean. While there are some that excel with Zilean's kit, most benefit from the speed up and protection with Zilean's ult.</p>
				<p>Maxing Time Bomb is more favorable with this group, but maxing Time Warp is fine.</p>

				<p>Ezreal is the only marksman that comes to mind who doesn't synergize well with Zilean in one form or another. Ezreal has plenty of mobility and great poke damage, but his burst within a 2 second combo is very low.</p>
				<p>If you do lane with a Zilean, you want to max Time Bomb and build AP, because you're going to try poking as hard as possible.</p>

			<h4>Enemy Marksmen Matchups</h4>
			<p>For the most part, the enemy support has a much larger impact on the lane than the AD Carry.</p>
			<p>There are some rough matchups for Zilean (those with dashes), and some good matches (those without dashes).</p>
			<p>AD Carries that do a massive amount of burst damage are dangerous to Zilean.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Similarly, the champions that work best with Zilean are also countered by Zilean. These champions have low mobility and very predictable playstyles. Against these champions, it's recommended that you max Time Warp because they have low damage in lane and their mispositioning can be exploited.</p>

				</div>
				<p>These are the standard champions that Zilean does OK against. Against these champions, it's important to know the limitations of the enemy support and cater your playstyle against that.</p>
				<p>Many of these champions have predictable burst points, and if you are playing correctly, you can identify when they are moving in for the kill (usually by advancing into a minion wave as you are retreating) and prepare to use your ultimate or throw bombs to zone if you aren't level 6 yet.</p>

				</div>
				<p>These are the marksmen with high mobility and high burst or poke and can destroy the lane if you get out of position slightly. These are the champions that can crush you in lane if you don't play intelligently.</p>
				<p>Ezreal has plenty of mobility and range, so landing Time Bombs without taking poke is very difficult.</p>
				<p>Sivir is the worst ADC matchup to play against because she has two chances to absorb the spell, either as it lands, or as it detonates. This makes it incredibly difficult to play around her spellshield.</p>
				<p>Many of the 4-star marksmen have incredible pre-6 damage and can easily zone you out (or engage for kills) if you are out of position. The enemy support will be a huge factor on if you should take a passive or aggressive playstyle against these marksmen.</p>

			<h4>Enemy Support Matchups</h4>
			<p>Zilean's greatest threat is the enemy support. There are so many unfavorable matchups that you have to play wisely.</p>
			<p>In general, All-In supports and heavy poke supports are strong against Zilean, while melee tanks are weak.</p>
			<p>You should decide if you are maxing Q or E based on the enemy support (not the AD Carry).</p>

				<p>If played properly, Shen does a massive of damage. If you haven't played against one, you need to know that if you get taunted at level 2, you will probably die. Support Shen is somewhat fragile, so you can poke him out over time.</p>

				<p>Sion can be a bit tricky. Normally, support Sion's max the minion knockback move, then walk up and do the knock up. He does a deceptive amount of damage and is extremely durable. Slowing Sion works out well.</p>

				<p>Sona's poke and sustain hurt, so just kill her quick with an all-in or consistent poke. She's an easy kill with levels in Q at levels 2, 4 and 5 if she's out of position.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Icon">
				<p>Soraka is commonly banned, but she isn't too much of a problem for Zilean. If you can land damage onto her, it works out well. With the changes to Soraka, she'll be winning most of the trades if she's smart and is maxing her Q. You will likely be forced into a passive lane if she maxes Heal first.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Icon">
				<p>Syndra is a tough support for Zilean because her ranged stun does plenty of damage and a long duration stun. You must pay attention to her ball placement and always be aware of her angle so she can't do her stun.</p>

				<p>Tahm Kench is a huge pain who can negate Double Bomb damage by eating his ally. Your best bet to winning this lane is by maxing Time Warp and having your marksman whittle him down.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Warp Icon">
				<p>After the rework, Taric is strong but he is predictable. Taric has mana problems, which means if you can poke down the enemy, Taric will have a hard time. Taric's ult is strong for dives, but Zilean can negate one death.</p>

				<p>This is a common and tough matchup into Zilean. Dodge hooks and Double Bomb the marksman is the strategy. This is a skill matchup, so you may have trouble if you aren't familiar laning against Thresh.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Icon">
				<p>All you have to do against Trundle is slow him when he tries to pillar you off. He has good sustain, so you can't really poke him out, so it is better all-in to get the kill with the help of the jungler.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Icon">
				<p>Veigar can get out of control if he lands enough skills on you. This matchup isn't difficult if you avoid his spells. His ultimate will kill you or your laner if below 30% HP, so be ready to Chronoshift if things go poorly.</p>

				<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Icon">
				<p>Vel'Koz's damage is weighted towards landing 3 abilities to do more damage, and his individual spell poke was taken down quite a bit. Vel'Koz will try to play far back, so it is difficult to land Double Bombs.</p>

				<p>Zyra is a huge pain in lane. Her damage and harass is high, and has the range advantage to win most trades against you. You may be forced to play passively against this lane in order to survive.</p>
