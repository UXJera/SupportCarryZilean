				<h1>Runes 101</h1>
				<p>Runes are the early game additions that give you an advantage during the early game and laning phase to the point where items are more defining to your champion.</p>
				<p>There are three sets of runes for Support Zilean that I commonly use.The first is a generic laning page that can deal with most lanes, and the second is an AP page that looks to out damage the enemy duo lane, and the third is a scaling CDR page that works defensively.</p>

			<p>The Scaling CDR page is useful for scaling into the game. It allows you to skip a 10% CDR item in your build, which will most commonly be the CDR Boots. This allows you to buy another set of boots that is better for the overall matchup (i.e. buying Merc Treads against a heavy AP/CC team).</p>
			<p>This page is useful when you can plan out your item build before the game starts and find an alternative item that won't bring you over the 45% CDR cap. Since the nerf to Boots of Swiftness (only granting 55 movespeed), I have moved away from this page and take one of the other two rune pages.</p>

				<h4>Red Marks</h4>
				<h6>Marks are the type of runes that have the best efficiency for physical offense and resistance penetration.</h6>
				<h5>Best Options</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Hybrid Penetration</span>8.1 Armor Penetration <br> 5.5 Magic Penetration</li>
							<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>AD </span>8.5 Attack Damage</li>
					</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Hybrid penetration reds are the best option for Support Zilean because it will slightly amplify both Time Bomb and auto attack damage in lane. Since mana is an issue for Zilean, you'll want to be harassing with auto attacks while conserving mana for Time Bombs.</p>
					<p>Attack Damage reds are also a viable choice for Support Zilean because your auto attack is a important part of your early laning harassment. The extra damage from AD is slightly higher than penetration runes, but becomes less effective around level 5, once enemies get the scaling armor from levels.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>OK to Use</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Armor </span>8.2 Armor</li>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Magic Penetration</span>7.8 Magic Penetration</li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
					<p>Of the two penetration runes, I tend to go with hybrid because I like to mix in auto attacks. Zilean has a decent auto attack range and can weave in auto attacks easily. However, if you are planning on going full damage, Magic Pen reds are a solid option (combined with AP Blues/Quints).</p>
					<p>Armor reds are common for tankier supports or in lanes where you're expecting to trade often. With Zilean, I tend to stay away from armor reds just because I play aggressive in lane and try to punish enemies as much as possible. If you're newer, armor runes should be just fine.</p>

			<h4>Yellow Seals</h4>
			<h6>Seals are the most efficient slot for defensive and health runes</h6>
			<h5>Best Options</h5>

					<li><img src="/img/runes/hp46.png" alt="HP Yellow"><span>Flat HP </span>72 HP<span>572 Starting HP</span></li>

				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>In most games as a support, you're either running armor yellows and HP quints, or HP yellows and armor quints. The overall cost efficiency for HP yellows is better than using armor yellows.</p>
					<p>If you are going full damage, you will want to take the armor yellows over HP, because the trades in the bottom lane are mostly physical.</p>

		<div class="content-container">

			<h4>Quintessences</h4>
			<h6>Even though Quints offer the greatest diversity of all the runes, there are only a handful of reasonable choices</h6>
			<h5>Best Options</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="Armor Quint"><span>Armor</span>13 Armor<span>32 Starting Armor</span></li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="HP Quint"><span>Flat HP </span>78 HP<span>578 Starting HP</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Armor quints have a higher value than HP quints. By taking Armor Quints and HP yellows, you gain an extra 4 armor at the cost of 6hp. Because of how scalar armor works, the extra 4 armor is worth more damage reduction than 6hp. Plus as you gain more levels, your armor increases as well at a much lower rate than HP, so you'd get even less value using HP quints over Armor quints.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>OK to Use</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/apq46.png" alt="HP Quint"><span>Flat AP </span>15 Ability Power<span>+13 dmg to Time Bomb (+11 to players)</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>AP quints are solid for Midlane Zilean, but are not as good for Support Zilean. Unless you are planning on running AP blues and quints, I advise against taking these.</p>
					<p>By not taking the defensive benefits of these runes, you have to be extra careful in lane. Missing the 13 armor or 78 HP is huge, and you could be forced out of lane easily. This means you're losing XP and harass gold, so the reward for the risk is not worth it in my opinion.</p>

			<h4>Blue Glyphs Options</h4>
			<h6>Blue Glyphs are the most situational of all the runes and have the most flexibility. <br>This is where YOU choose what works best for you and your playstyle. <br>I've listed the runes that I would recommend, starting at the top and descending.</h6>
			<h5>Magic Resist</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>12 Magic Resist<span>30% Magic Dmg Reduction</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The base magic resist for most champions is 30 (as opposed to armor which can be as low as 14), so you have a better buffer thanks to base stats, which makes MR runes more of a luxury.</p>
					<p>At 30 MR, you have a 23% damage reduction to magic attacks, and with 42 that is bumped up to 30%.</p>
					<p>Thinking long-term, these runes are quite good. Zilean has no MR gain through his levels, and the choices for MR items for Zilean are lacking.</p>
					<p>In the lane, AP heavy "support" mages do significant damage early on (Brand, Vel'Koz, Karma, just to list a few) and every bit of MR helps you stay in lane just a little longer.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>Scaling CDR</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>CDR / Level</span>10% CDR at level 18<span>1% CDR every other level</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set of runes that helps you as the game goes on. Early in lane, the extra CDR isn't necessary because your mana pool is too small to spam out spells, but around 15-20 minutes, then these runes pick up steam.</p>
						<p>I've been experimenting with these runes and taking Boots of Swiftness over CDR boots, and it has had decent success against slow-heavy teams. This may be an alternative if you are wanting to reach the CDR cap, but still have some freedom with some of the later items with Zilean.</p>
						<p>Plus, you have an extra 3 rune slots to add in an extra 4 MR (which will put you at 25% magic damage resistance)</p>
					</div>
					<h5>Flat AP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Flat AP</span>11 Ability Power<span>+10 dmg to Time Bomb (+7 to players)</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I'm usually against taking AP runes on Support Zilean for the fact that only 2 spells benefit from AP, and the base damage from Time Bomb and Spellthief's/Frostfang are much more potent than the extra 7-8 damage per bomb (depending on how much MR they are running).</p>
					<p>There are some Zilean pages that do run about 25 AP out of the gate, but it puts them in a rough position where one bad trade will halt your offensive.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>Flat Mana</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/cdr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Flat Mana</span>101 Mana<span>1 Free Rewind and Time Bomb</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set that I am not completely sold on. At level 1, Zilean has a base of 361 mana, so you end up with about 25% more mana at level 1.</p>
						<p>Having a larger mana pool also makes the Meditation talent more effective, meaning you'll be getting more mana back from that passive the lower your mana pool is.</p>
						<p>I plan on testing out this combination of extra mana blues to see just how much of an impact it makes in the early game.</p>
					</div>
				<h5>Flat Mana Regen</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>3.0 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds<span>1 Free Rewind (W) per minute</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Mana regen blues are somewhat of an OK choice. Early in the game, they do help tide you over until you have enough regen from Tear of the Goddess or Frostfang, but these quickly lose their value.</p>
						<p>The value of these runes equate to 1 free Rewind per minute, or a free Time Bomb every other minute.</p>
						<p>In short, these runes grant 25% mana regeneration at level 1, but as the game goes on, it gets less and less, so items with % mana regeneration are far superior.</p>
					</div>
			<h4>6/3 Split Variant Blue Glyphs</h4>
			<h5>Using 6 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>8 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>2 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdr46.png" alt="CDR Blue Runes"><span>Flat CDR</span>5% CDR</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Regen Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>10% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
			<h5>Using 3 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>4 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>1 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>5% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The 8 Magic Resist is the most common compromise if you plan on mixing in only 1 Mana per 5S.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 Mana Regen per 5 works best with the 4 Magic Resist. This diluting of MR and MReg works better for supports with fewer mana problems (Bard comes to mind), but I'd either stick w/ either all magic resist or all mana regen.</p>
					<p>Flat CDR is more common in the jungle, but the downside is that you only get 5%. On Support Zilean, it will make things awkward where there will be a 5% CDR gap. The problem is that there are no 5% CDR items in the game anymore, so you either sacrifice the possibility of 45% CDR or you go over the CDR cap and make the CDR runes useless.</p>
					<p>Scaling CDR's are common among midlaners, since you'll likely hit 16-18 before the game ends. Supports don't have that luxury (although Zilean's passive puts his XP much higher than other supports). It's an alright choice, but you'll have to give up a CDR item like Talisman of Ascension or Banner of Command/Mikael's in order to stay under the CDR cap.</p>

			<h4>Which Rune Page should I be using?</h4>
			<h5>Safety and Scaling</h5>
			<p>In most cases, the more defensive (and better for learning) is the safer page, which takes this set of runes below. If you don't have these runes or the runepage space, you can always play it safe and go with a standard defensive page.</p>
			<div class="rune-page-block">
				<a href="/img/runes/runepage-1.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="/img/runes/runepage-1.jpg" alt="My most common runepage"></a>
			</div>
			<h5>Aggression and Poke</h5>
			<p>Once you are more comfortable with Zilean, and have <a href="/basic-guides/laning-matchups/">a favorable lane matchup</a>, or if you want to play super aggressive, you can go with the page below. This page does have some downsides, you are vulnerable to all-ins and punishment for missed bombs and being out of position. If you are in an unfavorable lane, you will end up being more of a hinderance, as the bombs will push the wave away from your turret, making your duo lane vulnerable to ganks and zoning.</p>
