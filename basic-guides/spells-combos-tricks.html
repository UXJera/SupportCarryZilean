				<h1>Spells, Combos, and Tricks</h1>
				<p>On paper, Zilean is a fairly simple combo mage. You have a core damage spell (Time Bomb), an ability that does a significant slow/haste (Time Warp), and a spell that reduces the cooldown on those two spells (Rewind).</p>
				<p>Your most basic combination is Time Bomb -> Rewind -> Time Bomb, which does a fair amount of damage and lands a short stun. However, there is much more to Zilean's kit than Double Bombs.</p>
				<p>Zilean is also highly mobile, despite not having a dedicated gap closer. He is also slippery in that he can escape enemy "picks" with his ultimate, Flash Summoner, and Time Warp speed up. This makes Zilean very difficult to pin down if played properly.</p>
				<p>The first section of this guide goes through the exact numbers and descriptions of Zilean's spells and passives, and includes a brief explanation about the ability in practical usage (the numbers are great, but you need the application of the skills for things to make sense).</p>
				<p>Near the end of this guide will have some examples of how and when you can use Zilean's kit to give you the competitive edge on the battlefield.</p>
				<p>In most cases, you will want to max Time Bomb (Q), then Rewind (W), Chronoshift (R), and ending off with Time Warp (E). But maxing Time Warp first is still incredibly powerful. For more information on when you should max each, you can check out the <a href="/advanced-guides/the-great-q-vs-e-debate.html">Great Q vs E Debate.</a></p>

				<p>You can give away free levels to your laner, jungler, or any other teammate if you have the banked XP, if they are close to level, and if they are close to you in proximity.</p>
				<p><span>Giving your laner the boost from level 2 -> 3 and level 4 -> 5 is the best practice for Zilean.</span> The XP that you grant from level 1 -> 2 is the same value as killing a single ranged creep and is not worth the 2 minute cooldown on the passive.</p>
				<p>The true power of this passive happens when you reach mid game and you should always have a level advantage on the opposing support. The passive also alleviates the XP loss for roaming around the map.</p>

				<p>Time Warp is an incredibly potent mobility spell that can be used offensively or defensively. With 3 ranks into the spell, it becomes incredibly oppressive to play against.</p>
				<p>While maxing Time Bomb is the standard thing to do, maxing Time Warp is incredibly powerful if you have a good team to play around it.</p>
				<p>One thing to note is that the only attribute that changes with spell ranks is the movement speed modifier. This means that you will want to have at least 20% CDR so that you will be able to chain a second Time Warp after using Rewind.</p>

				<p>Chronoshift is the ultimate ability for Zilean and one of the hardest parts of Zilean's kit to master. The reason this skill is so powerful isn't just because it revives a fallen teammate, but <span>it also soaks up the spells and abilities from enemies.</span> In short, you can trade a low cooldown res ultimate for 2 or 3 powerful spells and summoners.</p>
				<p>When you start thinking about what spells the enemy had wasted, you truly see the power and efficiency that a low-economy Zilean brings to a group.</p>
				<p>In most cases, you will want to save the ultimate for your ADC during a teamfight, but if you have baited enough ultimates from the enemy, it is fine to cast Chronoshift on your tank or bruiser.</p>
				<p>Just know that if a teamfight doesn't go your way, each teammate is going to wonder why you ressed someone other than them. Just ignore them, and try to not die with your ultimate available.</p>

		<h2>Tricks and Unique Techniques</h2>
		<div class="content-container">
			<p>Now that you know some of the tools for Zilean's kit, let's dive into some of the tricks that make him shine.</p>
			<p>In the future, I plan on having videos added to demonstrate these tricks for you.</p>
			<h4>Double Bombing Minions</h4>
			<div class="content-container">
				<div class="video-block">
					<div class="embed-container">
						<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3vj4iFpEhT4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>If you can't land the double bombs on the enemy, you can easily land a pair on minions, and have the stun the enemies if they are in the radius.</p>
			<h4>Double Bomb Your Friends!</h4>
			<p>Is your ally chasing down an enemy and can't quite catch up? You can toss a two bombs on their head and it will detonate for the stun! It's also very fun to tag Elise's Spiderlings and watch her get stunned.</p>
			<h4>Double Bombing Yourself</h4>
			<p>This tactic works well if you are about to be jumped on by someone with a gap closer or are about to revive after Chronoshift. You can use the double bombs on yourself to give your self some distance. This doesn't always work because bombs tend to prioritize enemy champions, but this is possible.</p>
			<h4>Double Bomb on a Reviving Target</h4>
			<p>This is great for peeling off melee who stand on top of a reviving target, waiting to get that juicy killing blow.</p>
			<h4>Double Bombs as a Zoning Tool</h4>
			<p>Double Bombs don't have to always land to be effective. Since the duration on Time Bomb is 3 seconds, you can throw two bombs down to create a zone where enemies won't dare go, for fear of the stun and damage.</p>
			<h4>Single Bombs as a Zoning Tool</h4>
			<p>This trick isn't always effective, but it can make enemies make tough decisions on their positioning. You can toss a single bomb into the minion wave to zone back enemies. This is useful outside of laning where you can zone off melee champions who are looking to push back a wave.</p>
			<h4>Chronoshift as an Escape Tool</h4>
			<p>This trick involves casting Chronoshift early in a fight to disuade enemies from killing off a teammate, and giving that person enough time to initate the fight or disengage.</p>
			<p>This typically works better in Platinum+ elos where people understand the game better. If you are playing in lower elos, using Chronoshift early is a great way to bait out enemy spells and cooldowns.</p>
			<h4>Flash Slow into Double Bomb</h4>
			<div class="content-container">
				<div class="video-block">
					<div class="embed-container">
						<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/n7F1pdg15Ec" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>This trick is very useful to ensure you land a Double Bomb combo because the travel distance from Time Bomb is short enough that characters are unable to juke and must use Flash to escape.</p>
			<p>Remember to Flash when you are at max Time Bomb range then cast Time Warp (E) to slow. Quickly hit Q W Q to land the bombs and hope your team has enough follow up to secure the kill.</p>
