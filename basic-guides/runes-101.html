				<h1>Runes 101</h1>
				<p>Runes are the early game additions that give you an advantage during the early game and laning phasem until the point where items are more defining to your champion.</p>
				<p>There are three sets of runes for Support Zilean that are recommended depending on your playstyle. The first is a standard support mage runepage that works great in every situation. The second is a full AP page that looks to bully the enemy duo lane, and the final is a scaling CDR page that works defensively in lane.</p>

				<p>This runepage is the common runepage set up for mages played as supports and works well in most matchups. This is a balance from the defensive page and the full damage page, which fits in with all playstyles.</p>

				<p>The main strength of this page is that it gives you flexibility to go into any item build or skill order. It allows you to play aggressively or reactively.</p>

				<p>This runepage is one you can also use when you are starting out to learn Support Zilean or if you are in against a heavy poke or AP mage lane.</p>
				<p>Zilean's weakest point in the game is pre-6. He is limited by mana, spell cooldown, and lack of items to aid him. These runes help weather the storm and make it a little harder to be killed in lane.</p>
				<p>Playing super passively makes it harder for your ADC to CS comfortably and also leads to more of the damage focus onto the ADC. This can lead to de-synced backs, a reliance to stay in lane with your ADC while the enemy support roams, and a gold deficit.</p>
				<p>But once gain, there are going to be games where the enemy lane is overwhelmingly powerful and you are forced into this playstyle. I don't recommend this page for every single game, but for those matchups where you are going to have a very rough lane.</p>

			<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>The extra 10% CDR from runes makes it so you have another option on which upgraded boots you want to take. Most of the time, I go with Boots of Swiftness because it is incredibly hard to catch Zilean.</p>
				<p>Also coming to lane with 20% CDR means you can throw single Time Bombs to poke and have it come off cooldown a few seconds earlier.</p>
				<p>In theory this could be used in an AP focused build which gets CDR from Morellonomicon and Eye of the Watchers, but I have had great success with this build going the LCS / Utility Build.</p>

				<h4>Red Marks</h4>
				<h6>Marks are the type of runes that have the best efficiency for physical offense and resistance penetration.</h6>

					</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Magic penetration reds gives you the biggest bang for your buck as Support Zilean. Your Time Bombs will hit harder, and with the removal of the magic resist aura from Aegis of the Legion, cheap magic resist is inconvenient to build into for most non-tanks.</p>
					<p>Attack Damage reds are also a viable choice for Support Zilean because your auto attack is a important part of your early laning harassment. The extra damage from AD is slightly higher than penetration runes, but becomes less effective around level 5, once enemies get the scaling armor from levels. This also helps you auto attack down minions to help push the lane or last hit if your ADC has backed.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>OK to Use</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/red-armor.png" alt="Armor Red Runes"><span>Armor </span>8.2 Armor</li>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/red-precision.png" alt="Precision Red Runes"><span>Precision</span>10.2 Lethality <br> 5.5 Magic Penetration</li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
					<p>Hybrid penetration runes are great when you can mix in auto attacks. Zilean has a decent auto attack range and can weave in auto attacks easily. With the changes to Lethality (armor pen) scaling better with levels, hybrid penetration runes are much weaker than in Season 6. If you are planning on going full damage build, Magic Pen reds are a better option.</p>
					<p>Armor reds are common for tankier supports or in lanes where you're expecting to trade often. With Zilean, it's better stay away from armor reds because you end up missing out on a potentially offensive stat that is normally provided from red runes. If you're newer or are against a heavy poke AD, armor runes should be just fine.</p>

					<p>In most games as a support, you're either running armor yellows and HP quints, or HP yellows and armor quints. The overall cost efficiency for HP yellows is better than using armor yellows.</p>

			<h5>Best Options</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/quint-armor.png" alt="Armor Quint"><span>Armor</span>13 Armor<span>32 Starting Armor</span></li>

				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Armor quints have a higher value than HP quints. By taking Armor Quints and HP yellows, you gain an extra 4 armor at the cost of 6hp. Because of how scalar armor works, the extra 4 armor is worth more damage reduction than 6hp. Plus as you gain more levels, your armor increases as well at a much lower rate than HP, so you'd get even less value using HP quints over Armor quints.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>OK to Use</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/quint-ap.png" alt="AP Quint"><span>Flat AP </span>14.9 Ability Power<span>+13 dmg to Time Bomb (+11 to players)</span></li>

				<div class="explanation">
					<p>AP quints are solid for Midlane Zilean, but are not as good for Support Zilean. Unless you are planning on running AP blues and quints, I advise against taking these.</p>
					<p>By not taking the defensive benefits of these runes, you have to be extra careful in lane. Missing the 13 armor or 78 HP is huge, and you could be forced out of lane easily. This means you're losing XP and harass gold, so the reward for the risk is not worth it in my opinion.</p>

			<h4>Blue Glyphs Options</h4>
			<h6>Blue Glyphs are the most situational of all the runes and have the most flexibility. <br>This is where <span>YOU</span> choose what works best for you and your playstyle. <br>Below are the list of recommend blue runes, starting with the best at the top and descend.</h6>
			<h5>Flat AP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-ap.png" alt="AP Blue Runes"><span>Flat AP</span>10.7 Ability Power<span>+10 dmg to Time Bomb (+7 to players)</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>In most cases, taking the extra AP for lane is the right way to go.</p>
				<p>If you are not comfortable playing aggressively or are learning Support Zilean, you may want to take Magic Resist instead just to have a higher stability.</p>
				<p>The extra AP makes your Time Bomb hit just a little harder, and can also be used to help push a lane by throwing a single Time Bomb on the caster minions and let the ADC clear.</p>
			</div>

			<h5>Magic Resist</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mr.png" alt="MR Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>12 Magic Resist<span>30% Magic Dmg Reduction</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The base magic resist for most champions is 30 (as opposed to armor which can be as low as 14), so you have a better buffer thanks to base stats, which makes MR runes more of a luxury.</p>
					<p>At 30 MR, you have a 23% damage reduction to magic attacks, and with 42 that is bumped up to 30%.</p>
					<p>Thinking long-term, these runes are quite good. Zilean has no MR gain through his levels, and the choices for MR items for Zilean are lacking.</p>
					<p>In the lane, AP heavy "support" mages do significant damage early on (Brand, Vel'Koz, Karma, just to list a few) and every bit of MR helps you stay in lane just a little longer.</p>
				</div>

				<h5>Scaling CDR</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-cdr-scaling.png" alt="CDR Scaling Blue Runes"><span>CDR / Level</span>10% CDR at level 18<span>1% CDR every other level</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set of runes that helps you as the game goes on. Early in lane, the extra CDR isn't necessary because your mana pool is too small to spam out spells, but around 15-20 minutes, then these runes pick up steam.</p>
						<p>The big trade-off for these runes is that the number of support centric items with CDR are plentiful, making it very easy to itemize into 40% CDR. You need to be mindful of this, otherwise you end up making your items/runes less efficient.</p>
						<p>A positive of these runes is that there are 3 extra rune slots where you can add in an extra 4 MR (which will put you at 25% magic damage resistance).</p>
					</div>

				<h5>Flat Mana</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mana.png" alt="Mana Blue Runes"><span>Flat Mana</span>101 Mana<span>1 Free Rewind and Time Bomb</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set that I am not completely sold on. At level 1, Zilean has a base of 361 mana, so you end up with about 25% more mana at level 1 (462 mana).</p>
						<p>Having a larger mana pool also makes the Meditation talent more effective, meaning you'll be getting more mana back from that passive the lower your mana pool is.</p>
						<p>The primary reason I dislike this rune set up is that if you pick up a Tear of the Goddess, these runes lose most of their value since you shouldn't have any mana problems thereafter.</p>
					</div>
				<h5>Flat Mana Regen</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mana-regen.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>3.0 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds<span>1 Free Rewind (W) per minute</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Mana regen blues were popular several seasons ago, but have lost thier value as of late. Early in the game, they do help tide you over until you have enough regen from Tear of the Goddess or Frostfang, but these quickly lose their value.</p>
						<p>The value of these runes equate to 1 free Rewind per minute, or a free Time Bomb every other minute.</p>
						<p>In short, these runes grant 25% mana regeneration at level 1, but as the game goes on, the runes do not scale with your mana pool so items with %-based mana regeneration are far superior.</p>
					</div>
			<h4>6/3 Split Variant Blue Glyphs</h4>
			<h5>Using 6 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mr.png" alt="MR Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>8 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mana-regen.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>2 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-cdr.png" alt="CDR Blue Runes"><span>Flat CDR</span>5% CDR</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-cdr-scaling.png" alt="CDR Scaling Regen Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>10% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
			<h5>Using 3 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mr.png" alt="MR Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>4 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-mana-regen.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>1 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/blue-cdr-scaling.png" alt="CDR Scaling Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>5% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The 8 Magic Resist is the most common compromise if you plan on mixing in only 1 Mana per 5S.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 Mana Regen per 5 works best with the 4 Magic Resist. This diluting of MR and MReg works better for supports with fewer mana problems (Bard comes to mind), but I'd either stick w/ either all magic resist or all mana regen.</p>
					<p>Flat CDR is more common in the jungle, but the downside is that you only get 5%. On Support Zilean, it will make things awkward where there will be a 5% CDR gap. The problem is that there are no 5% CDR items in the game anymore, so you either sacrifice the possibility of 45% CDR or you go over the CDR cap and make the CDR runes useless.</p>
					<p>Scaling CDR's are common among midlaners, since you'll likely hit 16-18 before the game ends. Supports don't have that luxury (although Zilean's passive puts his XP much higher than other supports). It's an alright choice, but you'll have to give up a CDR item like Talisman of Ascension or Banner of Command/Mikael's in order to stay under the CDR cap.</p>
