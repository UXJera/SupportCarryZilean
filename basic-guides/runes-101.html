				<h1>Runes 101</h1>
				<p>Runes are the early game additions that give you an advantage during the early game and laning phasem until the point where items are more defining to your champion.</p>
				<p>There are three sets of runes for Support Zilean that are recommended depending on your playstyle. The first is a standard support mage runepage that works great in every situation. The second is a full AP page that looks to bully the enemy duo lane, and the final is a scaling CDR page that works defensively in lane.</p>

				<p>This runepage is the common runepage set up for mages played as supports and works well in most matchups. This is a balance from the defensive page and the full damage page, which fits in with all playstyles.</p>

				<p>The main strength of this page is that it gives you flexibility to go into any item build or skill order. It allows you to play aggressively or reactively.</p>

				<p>This runepage is great if you plan on destroying your lane. You'll want to pick this into a favorable lane matchup or if you are a more experienced Zilean player.</p>
				<p>The key to this page is using Time Bomb efficiently and not stealing too much CS, while poking down the enemy ADC, as the sustain is a bit lower than a 3-potion support.</p>
				<p>When you run this runepage, you are likely to itemize more into AP than defensive/utility. This is fine, as it effectively makes you another damage threat to the enemy team.</p>
				<p>After speaking to many Support Zilean mains, many love this page and many hate it. Some prefer to take over the game themselves, while others work to empower the team. This runepage works best for those with an aggressive playstyle and actively seek to carry the game with or without the help of the team.</p>
				<p>Looking at the negatives, this runepage makes you is vulnerable to dying in lane because of the low defensive stats. You need to play assertively and ward properly, since your goal is to win the lane and start building AP for the post lane phase.</p>

				<p>In season 7, many of the utility support and AP items come included with plenty of CDR on board. This means that this page may not be as relevant due to the increased number of CDR support items.</p>
				<p>This runepage is similar to the common Zilean mid build, except it uses Armor Quints instead of AP. These could easily be swapped out, but it makes you incredibly fragile in the early laning phase.</p>
				<p>With this rune build, you are looking to only take 3 CDR items. You can either itemize heavily into AP, or into utility. If you do go utility, be careful on what items you plan on building, as most of them include CDR.</p>

				<h4>Red Marks</h4>
				<h6>Marks are the type of runes that have the best efficiency for physical offense and resistance penetration.</h6>

					</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Magic penetration reds gives you the biggest bang for your buck as Support Zilean. Your Time Bombs will hit harder, and with the removal of the magic resist aura from Aegis of the Legion, cheap magic resist is inconvenient to build into for most non-tanks.</p>
					<p>Attack Damage reds are also a viable choice for Support Zilean because your auto attack is a important part of your early laning harassment. The extra damage from AD is slightly higher than penetration runes, but becomes less effective around level 5, once enemies get the scaling armor from levels. This also helps you auto attack down minions to help push the lane or last hit if your ADC has backed.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>OK to Use</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Armor </span>8.2 Armor</li>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Hybrid Penetration</span>10.2 Lethality <br> 5.5 Magic Penetration</li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
					<p>Hybrid penetration runes are great when you can mix in auto attacks. Zilean has a decent auto attack range and can weave in auto attacks easily. With the changes to Lethality (armor pen) scaling better with levels, hybrid penetration runes are much weaker than in Season 6. If you are planning on going full damage build, Magic Pen reds are a better option.</p>
					<p>Armor reds are common for tankier supports or in lanes where you're expecting to trade often. With Zilean, it's better stay away from armor reds because you end up missing out on a potentially offensive stat that is normally provided from red runes. If you're newer or are against a heavy poke AD, armor runes should be just fine.</p>

					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="Armor Quint"><span>Armor</span>13 Armor<span>32 Starting Armor</span></li>

				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Armor quints have a higher value than HP quints. By taking Armor Quints and HP yellows, you gain an extra 4 armor at the cost of 6hp. Because of how scalar armor works, the extra 4 armor is worth more damage reduction than 6hp. Plus as you gain more levels, your armor increases as well at a much lower rate than HP, so you'd get even less value using HP quints over Armor quints.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>OK to Use</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/apq46.png" alt="HP Quint"><span>Flat AP </span>14.9 Ability Power<span>+13 dmg to Time Bomb (+11 to players)</span></li>

				<div class="explanation">
					<p>AP quints are solid for Midlane Zilean, but are not as good for Support Zilean. Unless you are planning on running AP blues and quints, I advise against taking these.</p>
					<p>By not taking the defensive benefits of these runes, you have to be extra careful in lane. Missing the 13 armor or 78 HP is huge, and you could be forced out of lane easily. This means you're losing XP and harass gold, so the reward for the risk is not worth it in my opinion.</p>

			<h4>Blue Glyphs Options</h4>
			<h6>Blue Glyphs are the most situational of all the runes and have the most flexibility. <br>This is where <span>YOU</span> choose what works best for you and your playstyle. <br>Below are the list of recommend blue runes, starting with the best at the top and descend.</h6>
			<h5>Flat AP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Flat AP</span>10.7 Ability Power<span>+10 dmg to Time Bomb (+7 to players)</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>In most cases, taking the extra AP for lane is the right way to go.</p>
				<p>If you are not comfortable playing aggressively or are learning Support Zilean, you may want to take Magic Resist instead just to have a higher stability.</p>
				<p>The extra AP makes your Time Bomb hit just a little harder, and can also be used to help push a lane by throwing a single Time Bomb on the caster minions and let the ADC clear.</p>
			</div>

			<h5>Magic Resist</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>12 Magic Resist<span>30% Magic Dmg Reduction</span></li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The base magic resist for most champions is 30 (as opposed to armor which can be as low as 14), so you have a better buffer thanks to base stats, which makes MR runes more of a luxury.</p>
					<p>At 30 MR, you have a 23% damage reduction to magic attacks, and with 42 that is bumped up to 30%.</p>
					<p>Thinking long-term, these runes are quite good. Zilean has no MR gain through his levels, and the choices for MR items for Zilean are lacking.</p>
					<p>In the lane, AP heavy "support" mages do significant damage early on (Brand, Vel'Koz, Karma, just to list a few) and every bit of MR helps you stay in lane just a little longer.</p>
				</div>

				<h5>Scaling CDR</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>CDR / Level</span>10% CDR at level 18<span>1% CDR every other level</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set of runes that helps you as the game goes on. Early in lane, the extra CDR isn't necessary because your mana pool is too small to spam out spells, but around 15-20 minutes, then these runes pick up steam.</p>
						<p>The big trade-off for these runes is that the number of support centric items with CDR are plentiful, making it very easy to itemize into 40% CDR. You need to be mindful of this, otherwise you end up making your items/runes less efficient.</p>
						<p>A positive of these runes is that there are 3 extra rune slots where you can add in an extra 4 MR (which will put you at 25% magic damage resistance).</p>
					</div>

				<h5>Flat Mana</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/cdr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Flat Mana</span>101 Mana<span>1 Free Rewind and Time Bomb</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>This is an interesting set that I am not completely sold on. At level 1, Zilean has a base of 361 mana, so you end up with about 25% more mana at level 1 (462 mana).</p>
						<p>Having a larger mana pool also makes the Meditation talent more effective, meaning you'll be getting more mana back from that passive the lower your mana pool is.</p>
						<p>The primary reason I dislike this rune set up is that if you pick up a Tear of the Goddess, these runes lose most of their value since you shouldn't have any mana problems thereafter.</p>
					</div>
				<h5>Flat Mana Regen</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>3.0 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds<span>1 Free Rewind (W) per minute</span></li>
					</ul>
					<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Mana regen blues were popular several seasons ago, but have lost thier value as of late. Early in the game, they do help tide you over until you have enough regen from Tear of the Goddess or Frostfang, but these quickly lose their value.</p>
						<p>The value of these runes equate to 1 free Rewind per minute, or a free Time Bomb every other minute.</p>
						<p>In short, these runes grant 25% mana regeneration at level 1, but as the game goes on, the runes do not scale with your mana pool so items with %-based mana regeneration are far superior.</p>
					</div>
			<h4>6/3 Split Variant Blue Glyphs</h4>
			<h5>Using 6 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>8 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>2 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdr46.png" alt="CDR Blue Runes"><span>Flat CDR</span>5% CDR</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Regen Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>10% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
			<h5>Using 3 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>4 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>1 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>5% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The 8 Magic Resist is the most common compromise if you plan on mixing in only 1 Mana per 5S.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 Mana Regen per 5 works best with the 4 Magic Resist. This diluting of MR and MReg works better for supports with fewer mana problems (Bard comes to mind), but I'd either stick w/ either all magic resist or all mana regen.</p>
					<p>Flat CDR is more common in the jungle, but the downside is that you only get 5%. On Support Zilean, it will make things awkward where there will be a 5% CDR gap. The problem is that there are no 5% CDR items in the game anymore, so you either sacrifice the possibility of 45% CDR or you go over the CDR cap and make the CDR runes useless.</p>
					<p>Scaling CDR's are common among midlaners, since you'll likely hit 16-18 before the game ends. Supports don't have that luxury (although Zilean's passive puts his XP much higher than other supports). It's an alright choice, but you'll have to give up a CDR item like Talisman of Ascension or Banner of Command/Mikael's in order to stay under the CDR cap.</p>

				<p>Once you are more comfortable with Zilean, and have <a href="/basic-guides/laning-matchups.html">a favorable lane matchup</a>, or if you want to play super aggressive, you can go with the page below. This page does have some downsides, you are vulnerable to all-ins and punishment for missed bombs and being out of position. If you are in an unfavorable lane, you will end up being more of a hinderance, as the bombs will push the wave away from your turret, making your duo lane vulnerable to ganks and zoning.</p>
