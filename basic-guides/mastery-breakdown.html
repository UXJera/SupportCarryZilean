				<h1>Mastery Breakdown</h1>
				<p><span>Season 7 preface: </span>As in Season 6, there is no 18-point keystone mastery that synergizes perfectly with Zilean. In fact, there aren't many changes from the Season 6 mastery list to Season 7.</p>
				<p>Despite a lackluster selection for keystone talents, there are several minor talents in the Cunning Tree that work well with Zilean, so Cunning Tree is the most optimal mastery path.</p>
				<p>There are only a few "mandatory" talents that I recommend, such as Meditation, Bandit, and Intelligence. The other talents are simply the best of the alternative choices.</p>

					<p>The extra attack speed doesn't benefit Support Zilean at all, so take the extra 2% damage from abilities. This is more beneficial for an AP mid Zilean, but can work well for a Support Zilean, especially if you are focusing more on AP and maxing Time Bomb early.</p>

				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Fresh Blood is a solid talent for early game if you plan on playing aggressively vs your lane opponents. This skill does fall off after laning phase, but can pack a wallop early on.</p>
					<p>Expose Weakness is the best choice of the three because Double Bombs will give about 6 seconds of the debuff (3 for when the initial bomb goes, 3 more after the second). This is weaker than Fresh Blood during the early game but is much more powerful when grouped.</p>
					<p>The extra 3% damage should be fairly constant since you spam Time Bomb for zoning and stuns in teamfights.</p>
					<p>It should also be noted that Expose Weakness does not stack if other allies are using Expose Weakness. However, many other laners prefer Feast or Double Edged Sword to be stronger in lane.</p>
					<p>Feast isn't good for supports, period.</p>

				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The spell vamp isn't useful for Zilean because it has reduced effect on AoE spells, so the AD/AP per level is better by default. An extra 15AP isn't a deal breaker late game, but it is far better than the alternative.</p>

				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Of the three, Battle Trance is easily the best for Support Zilean for damage. When your Time Bomb lands on a champion, you are put into combat for a minimum of 3 seconds automatically, so it is very easy to reach the max value for this effect.</p>
					<p>The other two options are too conditional or have too high of a risk associated. Even for mid lane, Battle Trance is the best pick.</p>

						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Of all the keystones in this tree, this is the best choice, although it isn't a very good one.</p>
							<p>Since Time Bomb is your only damaging spell and deals 50% less Deathfire Touch damage, it is better to just go the Thunderlord's Decree route and get either of the better Tier 3 talents in that tree.</p>

					<p>The mana regen is probably the best talent to take a Support Zilean in the entire mastery list. When you build more mana, you get an even greater effect from this talent. This is huge when you buy a Tear of the Goddess early, which solves most of Zilean's mana problems.</p>
					<p>Near the end of the game, your mana pool will be well over 2000 mana, and even at half mana, you'll be getting at least 15 mana per 5, and even more the lower your mana is. This helps Zilean use his bombs for scouting and zoning, and be liberal with the use of Time Warp.</p>

				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The health regen is better for Zilean in lane because as you auto attack the enemy, the minions WILL attack you back and deal a considerable amount of damage. This helps you bounce back from that deficit.</p>
					<p>The extra Armor/MR isn't worth it because Zilean typically builds only 1 moderate resist item of each type. I do recommend picking up a Zeke's Harbinger and an item that builds out of Chalice, the extra 5% adds up to an extra 1-2 Armor and MR.</p>

					<p>These 3 choices can be changed depending on what matchup you are playing into. Planning to roam more? Take Explorer. Want to play aggressive? Take Tough Skin. Planning to have a rough time in lane? Take Siegemaster.</p>
					<p>Generally, I prefer the extra MS in the river and brush because it makes escapes much easier. This movement speed is added onto the base movement speed, so you get a higher scaling Time Warp in the river. I like the utility of this talent over the minuscule damage reduction.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra 50HP is the best option here. This is an early game talent which equates to 6 HP Seals or 2 HP Quints, so it is a substantial amount of health. If you are running HP seals or quints, this will put you over 600HP going to lane, which is good for learning and facing aggressive lanes.</p>
					<p>The only benefit from the Runic Armor is the extra 8% increase to your regeneration and health from Ancient Coin, if you choose to go that item. This is such a small amount that it isn't worth it. You gain an extra 0.1 hp regen per 2 seconds in lane and a 0.9 hp regen when using a potion.</p>

				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The lower cooldown on Summoner Spells is the most common choice in this tree, for good reason. For example, if you are tracking your opponents summoner spells by their default values (see chart above), you may be off by 45 seconds on a Flash timing (255s vs 300s Flash). Also having these spells more readily available makes more opportunities to engage/prevent plays.</p>
					<p>The extra health regen is not that useful. Since Support Zilean has decent sustain if you go with the Ancient Coin and three potions, this mastery is a bit unnecessary for him.</p>
					<p>Fearless is not a worthwhile talent to take for Support Zilean because he should not be tanking and does not have enough base tank stats to make this talent useful.</p>

				</ul>
				<button class="discussion"><span>Discussion</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra tenacity is a nice thought, but Zilean is supposed to be elusive and able to run away before those hard CC spells land. Often this is useful in the early game while Zilean gets the levels and items needed to leave an impact in the game.</p>
					<p>The bonus to defenses when enemies are around is not a good thing for Zilean, as he shouldn't be anywhere near the enemy team's core. At most, you will have 3 people diving in, which only grants you 9 armor/mr in a position where you shouldn't be. Ultimately, this talent is best for champions who engage, and Zilean does best counter-engaging and creating picks. </p>

						<div class="explanation">
							<p>The auto attacks stealing 7-10 health seems alright, but the damage you take from the creeps attacking you back is not worth the small amount of life stolen. Plus you have to actively be in combat to use this, which turns off your passive for 10 seconds.</p>
							<p>In the late game, Zilean doesn't have a large HP pool and you shouldn't be able to get free auto attacks outside of picking off an enemy straggler.</p>

						<div class="explanation">
							<p>This talent is great for initiating tanks, but isn't great for Zilean. Zilean does have an easy time landing mutli-member crowd controls, but most of the time there is movement away from the fight so the shield would quickly fall off before damage can be absorbed.</p>
