Big difference between Winning and getting S on Support Zilean

Getting S

- Heavily weighted towards damage
- You have to max Q, and deal plenty of damage
- Weighted to have more farm
- Weighted to have low death count, high kill count
- Rewards placing wards, sweeping wards

Winning the game

- Timing ultimate properly
- Being considerate of avoiding taking farm/kills (to not tilt your ADC)
- Building to empower your team, vs carrying by yourself
