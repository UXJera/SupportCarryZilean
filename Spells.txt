COMBOS:

Double Bomb
Q + W + Q

Throw bombs at target: You may consider adding a slow in to ensure that the double bomb lands. It's tricky when you don't use slow.

Bombing minions for stun: This is great to use in lane or in places where you may not be in range to land both bombs. Minions (for the most part) are stationary and easy targets. It's an added bonus that the enemy now has to be careful where they stand in lane. If the minion dies to the first bomb, it detonates and deals the damage instantly, which is a decent burst at higher ranks.

Bombing self: This trick is valuable for when the enemy has a gap closer and jumps on top of you. You can throw a the bombs on your own head and it will detonate the stun, but it's a bit risky because the auto targeting for the bomb may prioritize the enemy over yourself. But it's much more effective than trying to throw bombs at someone before they use their gap closer.

Resurrection Bombing: This combo is useful when you cast Chronoshift on an ally. In most cases, the enemy will try to swarm the recently fallen ally as soon as they pop back up, and you may be able to land a double bomb combo to stun them and then (E) Time Warp your ally to safety. It doesn't work every time, but you can get make some outrageous saves if things go well.


Maximum CC : Slow into Double Bomb into Slow
