  Who am I?

Hi, I am Jera!

I am a freelance web designer who is passionate about League of Legends and eSports. In the past, I have been an eSports writer and analyst for an LCS team.

I built this website by myself as a passion project to answer any and all questions about Support Zilean and help people learn how to master the Support Zilean.

  What is my rank and how long have I been playing?

My current rank is Platinum and you can check my op.gg here <op.gg link>

I have been a support main since Season 2 and have ended most seasons in either gold or platinum. I do not spend as much time playing League as I used to, but I try to get at least 10 games in per week (mostly normals) and I try to keep up to date with current LCS strategies and meta changes.

  What makes my support style so special?

I am not a fan of many of the traditional supports. I do not find them challenging and would rather work harder to deserve my wins. After maining Janna season 2, and Morgana season 3, I want to show that there are still great support champions that aren't seen in every single draft pick.

At some point or another, I've played nearly every champion as a support. Some of it did not turn out well (I'm looking at you, Rumble and Gnar), while some of it was actually surprising awesome (support Kalista and Sion anyone?).

  Who are my favorite supports?

Some of the supports I love playing are Zilean, Gragas, Syndra, Lulu, and Ezreal (yes, Ezreal Support).

  Why Zilean?

In college, I was fascinated by how people experience time. To be more precise, how people view the passage of time when occupied with something that they enjoyed doing. Long story short, I enjoyed the lore and character of Zilean.

It wasn't until Zilean received his rework (which changed his Time Bomb from a point-and-click to a skillshot) that I really started picking up Zilean. After the rework, many considered Zilean "complete garbage" and discounted him entirely.
