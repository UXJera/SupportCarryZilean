				<h2>Runes 101</h2>
				<p>Runes are the early game additions that help you survive the early game and laning phase to the point where items are more defining to your champion.</p>
				<p>These are the runes that I use for Support Zilean. Below are the explanations and alternative choices to runes.</p>

				<h4>Red Marks</h4>
				<h6>Marks are the type of runes that have the best efficiency for physical offense.</h6>
				<h5>Best Options</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>AD </span>8.5 Attack Damage</li>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Armor </span>8.2 Armor</li>
					</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I really like the extra AD reds on my support rune pages because it gives a little extra oomph in lane where you don't have to be as reliant on landing combos to force out potions. AD also helps if you do have to last hit when your companion is gone and you're waiting for enough gold for a tear.</p>
					<p>Armor reds are common for tankier supports or in lanes where you're expecting to trade often. With Zilean, I tend to stay away from armor reds just because I play aggressive in lane and try to punish enemies as much as possible. If you're newer, armor runes should be just fine.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>OK to Use</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Hybrid Penetration</span>8.1 Armor Penetration <br> 5.5 Magic Penetration</li>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/ad46.png" alt="AD Red Runes"><span>Magic Penetration</span>7.8 Magic Penetration</li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
					<p>Of the two penetration runes, I tend to go with hybrid because I like to mix in auto attacks. If you do go with these runes, you're going to want to max Q to get the most of out the early game red runes. </p>
					</div>
				<h5>Not so Good</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><img src="/img/runes/mregm46.png" alt="Mreg Red Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>2.4 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds</li>
					</ul>
					<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>While I do recommend some sort of Mana Regen somewhere in the rune pages, the mana regen reds aren't anywhere near as efficient as their yellow or blue counterparts, so I do not recommend using them. There offensive value that the red runes give should not be squandered mana regen.</p>

			<h4>Yellow Seals</h4>
			<h6>Seals are the most efficient slot for defensive and health runes</h6>
			<h5>Best Options</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/hp46.png" alt="HP Yellow"><span>Flat HP </span>72 HP</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armors46.png" alt="Armor Yellow Runes"><span>Armor </span>9 Armor</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>In most games as a support, you're either running armor yellows and HP quints, or HP yellows and armor quints. The overall cost efficiency for HP yellows is better than using armor yellows. However, since armor yellows are much cheaper and a staple for most runepages, those are a decent fallback.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>Not so Good</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/hp46.png" alt="HP Yellow Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>3.7 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Mana regen yellows are actually the highest value for base regen of the three types of runes, but you sacrifice so much defensive stats I don't believe it's worth it. You're gimping yourself in lane because you will always have to be cautious for all-ins and are weaker in trading.</p>

			<h4>Quintessences</h4>
			<h6>Even though Quints offer the greatest diversity of all the runes, there are only a handful of reasonable choices</h6>
			<h5>Best Options</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="Armor Quint"><span>Armor</span>13 Armor </li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="HP Quint"><span>Flat HP </span>78 HP</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Armor quints have a higher value than HP quints. By taking Armor Quints and HP yellows, you gain an extra 4 armor at the cost of 6hp. Because of how scalar armor works, the extra 4 armor is worth more damage reduction than 6hp. Plus as you gain more levels, your armor increases as well at a much lower rate than HP, so you'd get even less value using HP quints over Armor quints.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>OK to Use</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/armor46.png" alt="HP Quint"><span>Flat AP </span>15 Ability Power</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>AP quints are solid for Midlane Zilean, but are not as good for Support Zilean. The extra damage is good if you plan on maxing Time Bomb (Q) first, but it does tend to steal CS from the ADC.</p>
					<p>When I've run 15AP quints in lane, my bombs hit a little harder,  and by that I mean instead of dealing ~55 damage at rank 1, you deal ~70. Since Zilean scales much better with CDR and Mana, the extra AP is wasted. It is better to get off more spell rotations at lower damage than dealing more damage with fewer spell rotations.</p>
					<p>In my opinion, the power of Support Zilean doesn't come from overwhelming damage, but the insane utility from his ultimate, slows, and the stun (not so much the damage from the stun). Surviving lane is the recommended approach when playing Support Zilean. There are many tough matchups for Zilean in the bottom, and if you make it out of lane with 3 or fewer deaths between you and your lane partner, you'll be in pretty good shape going into the mid game.</p>

			<h4>Blue Glyphs Options</h4>
			<h6>Blue Glyphs are the most situational of all the runes and have the most flexibility. <br>This is where YOU choose what works best for you. <br>I've listed the runes that I would recommend, starting at the top and decending.</h6>
			<h5>Flat Mana Regen</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regeneration</span>3.0 Mana Regen / 5 Seconds</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Since you've looked at the mana regen in the other two rune trees, here's where I choose to take them. In bottom lane, most of the damage that you're going to be taking is physical. Minion damage, auto attacks, ADC abilities. But more often then not, there are sources of AP damage that come from the support that you have to watch out for. For the most part, the AP damage is low enough that you don't have to make it a priority.</p>
					<p>There are some exceptions to this, and I'll explain more in the MR section.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>Magic Resist</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>12 Magic Resist</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Magic Resist blues are very common for other sets, so that's one reason to go with them. The base magic resist for most champions is 30 (as opposed to armor which can be as low as 14), so you have a better buffer thanks to base stats, which makes MR runes less needed in normal matchups.</p>
					<p>Some of the AP heavy "support" mages do significant damage early on (Brand, Vel'Koz, Karma, just to list a few) and every bit of MR helps stay in lane. Zilean has a tough time dealing with these AP heavy poke mages, but the sustain from the Ancient Coin is usually enough to keep him well enough (as long as you are dodging skill shots).</p>
				</div>
			<h5>Flat AP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Flat AP</span>11 Ability Power</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I do not like scaling runes on supports because it is very likely that you won't be reaching the efficency breakpoint until the mid-game, which means that you are gimping yourself in the early game. The way I play Support Zilean has many gimping mechanics to him (low damage, delayed sightstone, fragile levels 1-5) and there's no need to make laning more difficult.</p>
				</div>
			<h5>Scaling AP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/apsg46.png" alt="AP Scaling Blue Runes"><span>AP / Level</span>28 Ability Power @ 18</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Flat AP is ok if you are planning on maxing Q and going for damage. Much like the quints, you're going to be missing out on something, but the impact is much less noticable when you take AP blues.</p>
				</div>
			<h4>6/3 Split Variant Blue Glyphs</h4>
			<h5>Using 6 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>8 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>2 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdr46.png" alt="CDR Blue Runes"><span>Flat CDR</span>5% CDR</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Regen Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>10% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
			<h5>Using 3 Glyphs</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Magic Resist</span>4 Magic Resist</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/mr46.png" alt="Mana Regen Blue Runes"><span>Mana Regen</span>1 Mana / 5</li>
					<li><img src="/img/runes/cdrs46.png" alt="CDR Scaling Blue Runes"><span>Scaling CDR</span>5% CDR @ 18</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The 8 Magic Resist is the most common compromise if you plan on mixing in only 1 Mana per 5S.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 Mana Regen per 5 works best with the 4 Magic Resist. This diluting of MR and MReg works better for supports with fewer mana problems (Bard comes to mind), but I'd either stick w/ either all magic resist or all mana regen.</p>
					<p>Flat CDR is more common in the jungle, but the downside is that you only get 5%. On Support Zilean, it will make things awkward where there will be a 5% CDR gap. The problem is that there are no 5% CDR items in the game anymore, so you either sacrifice the possibility of 45% CDR or you go over the CDR cap and make the CDR runes useless.</p>
					<p>Scaling CDR's are common among midlaners, since you'll likely hit 16-18 before the game ends. Supports don't have that luxury (although Zilean's passive puts his XP much higher than other supports). It's an alright choice, but you'll have to give up a CDR item like Talisman of Ascension or Banner of Command/Mikael's in order to stay under the CDR cap.</p>

			<p>The runesets for Support Zilean are similar to the runesets for most supports, but I like the extra mana regen for safety in lane.</p>
