Q: Is Zilean solo queue viable in Patch 6.x?

A: Yes, as with most champions, having mastery of a champion will outweigh many of the downsides of a champion, as you know how to play around them. For many, playing "unfamiliar" champions have a small advantage.

Q: Is Zilean pro-play viable?

A: Yes and no. The current meta focuses on early picking supports that have hard engage (Braum/Alistar), although there are a few that favor better sustain champions (LCS Immortals).

Many LCS teams prefer the tanky supports with engages and stuns, and take those support picks early. Those picks deny the opponent and also mask the composition for another round.

In short, Zilean falls into the more passive/pure support that isn't favored by most teams.

 Element's support, Sprattel, did play support Zilean in the 3rd week of the spring split of the EU LCS.

Q: Who are you? And why should I trust what you're saying?

A: **OP.GG LINK** I started maining Zilean as a support the patch that his Time Bombs were changed from Point-and-Click spells to Skillshots (Patch 5.4 in Feb of 2015).
Before that, I was the lead analyst for CompLexity White (challenger team) and moved to CompLexity Black when they were making their run to get into LCS. I've been a content director at Cloth5.com, and have done many statistical analysis involving pick/ban decisions and game flow decision making. I've been playing League starting in season 2, and I've placed into High Platinum at my prime. If I had more time, I would aim for mid Diamond for Season 6.
