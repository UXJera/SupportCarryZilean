				<h2>Mastery Breakdown</h2>
				<p><span>Patch 5.24 preface: </span> Right now there isn't a single 18-point mastery that synergizes well with Support Zilean.</p>
				<p>However, there are talents in the Cunning Tree that work really well with Zilean (extra mana regen, extra CDR), so Cunning is the tree that I recommend going deep into.</p>
				<p>Zilean's early game is his weakest point, so many of the mastery talents are taken to alleviate some of the pain so that you can make it to the mid game in good shape.</p>
				<p>These are the masteries that have served me best in the over 300+ games I've played on Zilean this season.</p>

				<h4>Ferocity Talent Tree</h4>
				<h6>The Feroicity Tree is an offensive based tree that works best with for Mid Zilean and doesn't suit the needs of a Support Zilean.</h6>
				<h6>I do not recommend taking any points in this tree, but I will go through and show the strengths of each incase you want to do some experimenting.</h6>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Fury</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer11.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Fury">
						<p>+4% Attack Speed</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Sorcery</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer12.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Sorcery">
						<p>+2% increased Ability damage</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra attack speed doesn't benefit Support Zilean much, so I would take the 2% bonus damage. This is more beneficial for an AP mid Zilean, but can work well for a Support Zilean wants to focus more on AP and maxing Time Bomb first.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Double Edged Sword</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer111.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Double Edged Sword">
						<p>Melee: Deal 3% additional damage, take 1.5% additional damage</p>
						<p>Ranged: Deal and take 2% additional damage</p>
					</li>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Feast</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer112.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Feast">
						<p>Killing a unit restores 20 Health (25 second cooldown)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>This is a tricky one. Normally, you take Feast for the extra sustain in lane, but the extra 2% damage both given and taken can be a boon considering it is easier to kill you, and thus easier to trigger your ultimate.</p><p>This one is preferencial, and normally I'd stick with Feast, but Double Edge Sword isn't too bad.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Vampirism</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer21.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Vampirism">
						<p>+2% Lifesteal and Spell Vamp</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Natural Talent</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer22.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Natural Talent">
						<p>+10 Attack Damage and 15 Ability Power at level 18</p>
						<p>(.55 Attack Damage and .83 Ability Power per level)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The spell vamp isn't useful for Zilean because it has reduced effect on AoE spells, so the AD/AP per level is better by default. An extra 15AP isn't a deal breaker late game, but it is far better than the alternative.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Bounty Hunter</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer211.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Bounty Hunter">
						<p>Deal 1% increased damage for each unique enemy champion you have killed</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Oppressor</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer212.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Oppressor">
						<p>Deal 2.5% increased damage to targets with impaired movement (slow, stun, root, taunt, etc.)</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The Bounty Hunter can provide a max of 5% extra damage, but may reliably will maybe get a 2-3% when going AP. For a support, you do not want to try to take the kills, making this mastery useless.</p>
					<p>The extra damage to snared is a solid choice if you plan on using your slow in your spell combo. The extra damage will ONLY go off on the first bomb detonation unless you follow up with another slow spell at the end of the stun. Generally I take this option over Bounty Hunter because in team fights, there will be some crowd control effect on your target, so you get the bonus damage.</p>

						<h4>Battering Blows</h4>

						<p>7% Magic Penetration</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I do not recommend going this far into the tree because the final keystones are poor choices for Zilean.</p>
					<p>For this tree, the Magic Penetration is better than the Armor Penetration, but the flat penetration in Cunning is a better option overall.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="three-tree">
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Warlord's Bloodlust</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer311.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Warlord's Bloodlust">

						<p>When you deal damage to an enemy, you gain a stacking buff that causes auto attacks to deal bonus damage at max stacks</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Zilean shouldn't be getting enough auto attacks to reliably use this talent, so this is pointless.</p>
						</div>

						<h4>Deathfire Touch</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/fer313.png" alt="Ferocity Mastery: Fury">
						<p>Your spells cause enemy champions to take magic damage equal to 20% of your Ability Power, halved for Area of Effect spells</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Of all the keystones in this tree, this is the only real choice, but it isn't a very good one.</p>
							<p>Since Time Bomb is your only damaing spell and deals 50% less Deathfire Touch damage, it is better to just go the Thunderlord's Decree route and get either of the better Tier 3 talents in that tree.</p>

				<h4>Cunning Talent Tree</h4>
				<h6>The Cunning Tree is the ultility based tree, which has several powerful talents to aid the Zilean player.</h6>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Wanderer</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun11.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Wanderer">
						<p>3% Movement Speed out of combat</p>

						<p>Single attacks and spells deal 5 bonus damage to minions</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra 3% movespeed out of combat is a solid choice for early game. Unfortunatly, Movement Speed calculation is scalar (instead of being additive), so you end up with an extra 6 movement speed when using a maxed Time Warp.</p>
					<p>Having a little extra help killing minions in lane isn't worth taking since your ADC should be getting all of the farm anyways.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="three-tree">
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Runic Affinity</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun111.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Runic Affinity">
						<p>Jungle Buffs last 15% longer</p>
						<p>18 second longer on blue/red buff</p>

						<h4>Assassin</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun113.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Assassin">
						<p>Deal 1.5% increased damage when no allied champions are nearby</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Having the stronger potions is the best option in lane because it nets and extra 35 health that helps you sustain through the rough early game.</p>
					<p>Having the extra duration on the buff is better for a mid-laner, although I'd probably still take the stronger potions for mid-lane.</p>
					<p>Assassin is useless because you shouldn't be dueling anyone to begin with.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Merciless</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun21.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Merciless">
						<p>Deal 5% increased damage to champions below 40% health</p>

					<li>
						<h4>Meditation</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun22.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Meditation">
						<p>Regenerate 1.5% of your missing Mana every 5 seconds</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The mana regen is probably the best talent to take a Support Zilean in the entire mastery list. When you build more mana, you get an even greater effect from this talent. This is huge when you buy a Tear of the Goddess early, which solves most of Zilean's mana problems.</p>
					<p>The extra damage just isn't as valuable with Zilean's kit.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Bandit</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun211.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Bandit">
						<p>Gain 1 gold for each nearby minion killed by an ally.</p>
						<p>Gain 3 gold when hitting an enemy champion with a basic attack (5 second cooldown)</p>

						<h4>Dangerous Game</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun212.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Dangerous Game">
						<p>Champion kills and assists restore 5% of your missing Health and Mana</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>As a support, the default go-to is Bandit because it increases the passive gold generation and rewards for harassing in lane.</p>
					<p>The health/mana restoration on kill can be the saving grace in some situations, but Zilean's ultimate is far better insurance policy than Dangerous Game.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Precision</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun31.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Precision">
						<p>Gain 5 + .5 per level Armor Penetration</p>

						<h4>Intelligence</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun32.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Intelligence">
						<p>Your Cooldown Reduction cap is increased to 45% and you gain 5% Cooldown Reduction</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I prefer the extra 5% CDR because it has the highest value for Zilean in terms of spell rotations. Being able to get off as many double Time Bomb combos is the goal. I go into more details about the importance of CDR in the <a href="" target="_blank">CDR and You Guide.</a></p>
					<p>The flat armor/magic penetration has been argued as the better alternative to the Ferocity's percentage based tier 3 choice, but Precision is slated to be nerfed in the future. On almost any other champion, this would be the choice talent, but I value the extra CDR over more damage per spell.</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="three-tree">

						<h4>Stormraider's Surge</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun311.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Stormraider's Surge">
						<p>Dealing 30% of a champion's max Health within 2 seconds grants 35% Movement Speed for 3 seconds</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>As Support Zilean, there are a couple of reasons why you shouldn't take this.</p>
							<p>First, this mastery works best when maxing Time Bomb and doesn't work at all when maxing Time Warp.</p>
							<p>Second, you can cast your Time Warp on yourself for an even larger speed boost that is much more reliable.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Thunderlord's Decree</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Thunderlord's Decree">
						<p>Your 3rd attack or spell on an enemy champion deals 10 damage per level,
							<br>plus 30% of your bonus Attack Damage
							<br>plus 10% of your Ability Power</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>Out of all of the keystone masteries, this is the least terrible of the bunch. Landing 3 consecutive spells/attacks deals a decent burst.</p>
							<p>This is most useful in laning when you can land a double bomb combo and throw an auto attack to proc the Thunderlords.</p>
							<p>As the game progresses, this gets weaker and weaker (due to AP being limited and mispositioning being less forgiving).</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="unused">
						<h4>Windspeaker's Blessing</h4>
						<img src="/img/masteries/cun313.png" alt="Cunning Mastery: Windspeaker's Blessing">
						<p>Your heas and shields are 10% stronger<br>
							Additionally, shields and heals on other allies increase their armor and magic resist by a flat amount for 3 seconds</p>
						<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
						<div class="explanation">
							<p>If this mastery was changed to give the bonus to ANY buff given (or they just included movespeed bonus), this would be the best choice.</p>
							<p>Currently, the only spell that this procs off of is the Chronoshift revival, which offers no early game bonus, and a limited effect as the game goes on.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The health regen is better for Zilean in lane because as you auto attack the enemy, the minions WILL attack you back and deal a considerable amount of damage. This helps you bounce back from that deficit.</p>
					<p>The extra Armor/MR isn't worth it because Zilean doesn't build "tanky". While I do recommend picking up a Zeke's Harbinger and an item that builds out of Chalice, the extra bonus won't be enough to make a huge difference in the mid to late game.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I prefer the extra MS in the river and brush because it makes escapes much easier. I like the utility of this talent over the miniscule damage reduction.</p>
					<p>Taking 2 fewer damage from champions adds up over time, but each auto attack from an ADC will hit deal 50-60 damage, so you'll be taking a 25+ auto attacks negating enough damage from that first auto attack. This talent works better for supports with higher armor or armor steroids.</p>

				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The extra 45HP is the best choice for me. This is an early game talent (in which Zilean is weakest). If you are running HP seals or quints, this will put you over 600HP going to lane, which is good for a more passive support.</p>
					<p>The only benefit from this mastery is the extra 8% increase to your regeneration and health from Ancient Coin. This is such a small amount that it isn't worth it. You gain an extra 0.1 hp regen per 2 seconds in lane and a 0.9 hp regen when using a potion.</p>

						<p>+50% Base Health Regen, increased to +200% when below 25%  Health</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<button class="expand"><span>Show Explanation</span></button>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The lower cooldown on Summoner Spells is the most common choice in this tree, for good reason. For example, if you are tracking your opponents summoner spells by their default values (5 minute flash/teleport, 4 minute heal, 3.5minute exhaust/ignite), you may be off by 30 seconds on a flash timing (255sec/4.25minute flash/tp, 204sec/3.4minute heal, 179sec/3minute exhaust/ignite). Also having these spells more readily available makes more opportunities to engage/prevent plays.</p>
					<p>The extra health regen is not a bad talent at all, it's just better for those who expect to be staying in lane for long periods of time at a lower health. Since Support Zilean has great sustain with the Ancient Coin and three potions, this mastery is a bit unnecessary for him.</p>

					<p>The extra tenacity is a nice thought, but Zilean is supposed to be elusive and able to run away before those hard CC spells land. Often this is useful in the early game while Zilean gets the levels and items needed to leave an impact in the game.</p>
					<p>The bonus to defenses when enemies are around is not a good thing for Zilean, as he shouldn't be anywhere near the enemy team's core. At most, you will have 3 people diving in, which only grants you 9 armor/mr in a position where you shouldn't be. Ultimately, this talent is best for champions who engage, and Zilean does best counter-engaging and creating picks. </p>

							<p>The auto attacks stealing 9-12 health seems alright, but the damage you take from the creeps attacking you back is not worth the small amount of life stolen.</p>

							<p>The changes to siege minion timings make this an interesting choice.</p>
							<p>Sticking around in lane, you will get an about an extra 50-60 hp, but as the game goes on, siege minions come out every other wave (and every wave after 35 minutes), which means that reaching the bonus 300HP is guaranteed if the game goes long enough.</p>
							<p>The downside to this is that it doesn't help you much in the early game compared to the other options. The crux of this guide is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of Zilean, and making it out of the early game without too many problems is the primary objective.</p>

							<p>Out of all of the keystone talents in all trees, this is the second best option. You will almost always have a 6% damage reduction, and help out your lane partner by soaking some of his damage.</p>
