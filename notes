2:02

We start trading, Draven is at half life and has to use pot

2:33

We hit 2 first and pressure out support

3:33

I announce I am warding tri and to play safe

4:00 Poppy out of position, we begin fighting. We have to use summoners to escape, but no deaths and we start potting

4:20 Poppy is low health and out of position. We force her flash and Draven starts fighting sub 400 HP. Poppu retreats into her minions, and Draven is cut off and we get a quick kill. Poppy follows up and kills our ADC. I keep fighting her and drop her to single digit health.

5:00

I quickly back because I don't know where the jungle is and I want the ADC to get some XP while I shop. I buy tear and some potions and return to lane.

6:01

Poppy is out of position, so I slow her and try to double bomb. Jhin follows up with a snare, and draven starts attacking Zilean. We switch targets to Draven,  but Jhin gets pinned against the wall by Poppy and dies. Our jungle is nearby and decides to start fighting

6:17 Draven is below 400 HP and Fizz dives in, gets the kill, and dies under our tower.

6:30 Poppy tries to fight Zilean under the tower, gets caught in minions and I land a bomb on her. Ez kill.

6:45 Udyr is still around and I'm certain I can fight him with our massive minion wave, but he wisely retreats.

7:20 Second back, I buy more potions and a Sightstone.

7:30 My lane partner gets chuncked out and has to burn flash to escape.

8:00 Draven and Poppy are trying to zone us, but we keep fighting. I tank as much Draven damage for my ADC

8:40 Our jungler comes to lane because we are pushed to our tower. I slow the Draven and end up getting the kill with an Auto attack. We chunk out the poppy, but she manages to get away.

9:25 our jungle takes aggro from the turret and I ult him at the last moment and save him. Also, you can cancel the channel on Zilean's passive to use your ultimate.

9:45 Third back: I'm pretty fed. I buy a cloth armor and boots and plan going Zeke's herald early on.

10:35 Poppy wall slams Jhin and they get an easy kill. This would have been an easily preventable death if I didn't save Fizz from the turret a minute earlier.

10:55 I see Udyr doing the crab, and I think I'm about to get dove, so I ping for help. Their team backs off and takes dragon instead of diving.

11:30 I have 5 ap and 4 points into Time Bomb. Each time bomb does 172 damage to Draven

11:40 I notice the support is missing, so I start zoning out Draven. I land double bombs, and slow him. Jhin follows up with a snare and damage, and we get a very easy kill since Poppy is nowhere to be found.

12:10 We poke Poppy, who is alone and do some significant damage. Even though she doesn't take damage from the time bombs on the ground, it buys more auto attacks from Jhin since she has to move around the outside of the time bombs.

12:50 Draven decides to go all-in with the low haelth poppy and she pins Jhin. Jhin gets saved by Zilean ult

13:15 Sion TPs down into lane, and even though we were planning on backing, we stick around and fight more. A bomb lands on friendly yasou's head and ends up getting the kill onto Draven

14:10 4th back: Glacial, CDR boots, Frostfang

14:30 Now we enter the ARAM phase of the game, and I have the AP to push back waves

15:30 LOL OHDEAR

16:15 the power of double bombs on friendly units. We chunk out J4 and force him to all-in. Another auto attack kill for Zilean.

17:00 bombs stealing kills

17:10 We save Sion, twice w/ Double bombs and slows

18:15 An interesting 2v2, J4 dies before double bombs, and draven is finished by the 75 AP Zilean

20:40 We see udyr doing blue and move in to steal it. I somehow managed another auto attack kill on Udyr, and have to move quickly to save Jhin's life from Zed. PS: Picking Zilean into zed is insanely good.

21:05 now we get to see how hard it is to catch a Zilean with 1 rank into Time Warp. But the team gets caught out in the next minute, and we sort of throw the game back to them.

22:42 watch this, a 500 damage chunk to Zed and now he is forced to retreat

23:00 This is the time when we have our first big 5v5 (or 4v5 in our case) engagement. Notice how I machine gun out bombs, save the jhin, and get stuns on the divers

25:00 Final Back: At this point I'm rolling in the dough, so I complete my Seraphs and that brings from 75 AP to 223 AP.

25:25 instead of them rushing baron, the enemy decides to contest dragon. Zed goes crazy on me and gets the kill, and we toss the game back to them again.

28:00 We start positioning around baron and we begin to flank around them in the jungle. Ohdear has been getting smashed running around, and J4 goes all in. A quick Exhaust on him along with Zeke's Herald proccing leads to a very easy 2 kills.

28:35

We carry on, and get poppy, then draven. Meanwhile Zed tries to assassinate Jhin, so I preemptively ult him incase he hits the damage threshhold.
