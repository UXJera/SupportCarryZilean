30% right now w/ core build

Normally, the game is over by this point, but let's continue on other optional items and further build paths

Idol: 550g -> Chalice: 1000g -> Mikael's: 750g   -> 40% CDR CAP
	Very very good to get people out of sticky situations upon resurrection or if picked. Rush this over Zeke's if they have Ashe or some other crazy hard engage
	
Upgraded Sightstone: 1000g
	This guy also lowers the CD on activated items (in our case, Coin/Zekes/Mikaels/Banner). Good buy when you have coin, amazing buy when you have Mikaels.	
	
Fiendish: 800g -> Aegis: 1500g -> Banner: 600g -> 40% CDR CAP
	Consider buying aegis before fiendish if noone has the aegis and you are against 2 AP team. Situational item, can be good for AFK pushing
	
Armguard: 1200g -> NLR: 1250g -> Zhonya: 1050g
	This is the alternative to Banner if they have lots of Physical dmg. This is mostly to fend off physical burst, but can also be good to waste enemy time post res to getting cooldowns back up.	
	
NLR: 1250g -> Archangel's: 1100g (2350g)
	Luxury item if game is snowballing hard in YOUR favor or the team needs more magic dmg. Overall pretty solid. Hard to get 1250g in the bank + have open item slots, so you may have to save to outright buy one of these. Normally I save this for the very last item in a game.
