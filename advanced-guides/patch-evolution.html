		<h3>State of Zilean Support - Season 7</h3>
		<div class="content-container">
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<h4>Support Zilean Tier Ranking (7.3): B+</h4>
					<p>At this time, Lethality and Poke are the kings of ADC, and mage supports are at the top. Support Zilean works well in this meta (and has actually seen professional play in LCS and LCK).</p>
					<p>With the nerfs to former strong supports (Zyra/Malzahar), Zilean does go up in value. And as always, be extremely careful picking Zilean into the champions below.</p>
					<h5>Enemy champions to watch out for:</h5>

						<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jihn Icon">
					</div>
					<p>These are the champions to watch out for because they have large range and great poke damage and give Zilean a hard time during lane.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.3</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-73-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.3 is a major balance patch that is serving out many nerfs to some of the strongest champions on the rift. The hit list includes the following: Camille, Jayce, Kha'Zix, LeBlanc, Malzahar, Rengar, Vi and Zyra. For the purpose of this guide, I will only be focusing on the bottom lane matchups and not the impact of the other champions in other roles. But this should be a glorious day where many of these "overpowered" champions were toned down.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/malzahar.png" alt="Malzahar Icon">
					<h5><span>Malzahar</span></h5>
					<p>W - Delay on cast</p>
					<p>Support Malzahar was one of the more annoying picks of 7.2, but a decent matchup for Zilean.</p>
					<p>The previous playstyle for Malzahar to mash his W to quickly get the voidlings out, forcing whoever the target is to run away. By adding a delay there is more of a time for players to react and not get trampled.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<h5><span>Zyra</span></h5>
					<p>Plants Don't Auto Focus Nearby Champs
					<br>Q - Higher Mana Costs</p>
					<p>One of the issues with Zyra is that she could use her plants triggered by Q to zone out and poke marksmen trying to get CS at the back of thier minion wave. The problem was that the plants would focus the closest enemy champion and continue to focus until the champion leaves the attack range.</p>
					<p>This makes the Zyra lane much less punishing in lane. She is still extremely dangerous if you are out of position, but her poke damage will be contingent on landing her spells.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.2</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-72-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> 7.2 for Support Zilean can be summed up into a single point: Redemption nerfs (and it isn't as bad as you'd think). The trend of standard supports was to rush this item as soon as possible, but now it is OK to postpone this item a little longer. The nerf is painful for Zilean because the item was so strong, however this is a nerf across the board and not a direct hit on Zilean. Let's be honest here, Redemption is still strong but needed the early game power toned down.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/redemption64.png" alt="Redemption Icon">
					<h5><span>Redemption</span></h5>
					<p>Lower Health (400 -> 300)
					<br> Increased Mana Regen (75% -> 125%)
					<br> Heal nerfed for early game</p>
					<p>The big and most important change is the reduction of the heal. This change affects the early game usage by having a low base value that scales with levels, but ultimately has the same value as before at level 18.</p>
					<p>In a non-snowballed game, Zilean SHOULD be a higher level than the enemy support, which gives Redemption a little bit more umph over the other team.</p>
					<p>For a more in-depth discussion, you can check out the <a href="//www.reddit.com/r/ZileanMains/comments/5pywqs/redemption_nerf_and_you/" target="_blank">Zilean Redemption Reddit Thread</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/edgeofnight64.png" alt="Edge of Night Icon">
					<h5>Lethality</h5>
					<p>40 / 60 Ratio Reversed</p>
					<p>Lethality is the new armor penetration where the total amount is split between flat armor penetration and level-based penetration/ The old formula was 40% base, 60% scaling, but now it is the opposite; 60% base and 40% scaling.</p>
					<p>Many marksmen favor this item in lane which makes thier damage incredibly high without armor. Since supports and ADCs do not typically buy armor for some time in thier builds, lethality item rushes are potent for crushing lane.</p>
					<p>Another item of note is the Edge of Night. This item produces a spellshield that absorbs the 1st spell. This will negate the first bomb in a Double Bomb combo.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<h5>Lulu</h5>
					<p>Passive - Smoother Damage
					<br> Q - Lower mana costs</p>
					<p>Lulu was in a rough spot after a series of nerfs that forced her out of the solo lanes and back to the bottom of the map. The damage nerfs also made it questionable to max Q first, and instead max the shield, acting as a weaker version of Janna.</p>
					<p>This is a step to make Lulu more potent in the bottom lane. Lately, Lulu has been seen as a direct counter to Malzahar Support because a single auto from her is enough to pick off a Malzahar Voidling (which is a major part of his damage pre-6).</p>
					<p>Lulu is a tough match for Zilean, but these buffs don't swing Lulu into an overpowered state, thus the playstyle shouldn't change.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Jungle Changes</h5>
					<p>Later Spawns</p>
					<p>The jungle is still being perfected, and this latest iteration changes the spawn times of the Red or Blue off back to 1:40 (as it was in Season 6). You'll want to toss your bomb at 1:37 or 1:38 to make sure it detonates when the mob spawns.</p>

			<h3 id="/patch71">Patch 7.1</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-71-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.1 is the first patch of 2017 and is one of the minor balance patches.</p>
			<p>Things have gotten a bit weird over the past month without balance changes or LCS, and there is an emergence of AP mages in the bottom lane taking the place of ADCs. The current meta is awkward with ADCs being ineffective at almost every stage of the game.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/draven.png" alt="Draven Icon">
					<h5><span>Draven</span></h5>
					<p>Q - Stronger Spinning Axe
					<br> W - Lower Mana Costs</p>
					<p>Draven's Spinning Axe now comes with a base damage and also scales off of <span>BONUS</span> AD, when before it was based off of TOTAL AD (without any extra base damage). Draven will hit much harder earlier on, making extended trades treacherous.</p>
					<p>The second effect is that his movement speed buff (that refreshes when he catches an axe) has lower mana costs with ranks, meaning Draven may not need to build Essense Reaver to cope with his mana problems.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kalista.png" alt="Kalista Icon">
					<h5>Kalista</h5>
					<p>E - Rend improvements</p>
					<p>Kalista's Rend has some problems before, stacks wouldn't accumulate when Rend was on CD, the reset on Rend not triggering, and the awkward 2-kills to refund the mana.</p>
					<p>Now that has been changed: the spears DO accumulate if Rend is on CD and the bug where Rend wasn't resetting was "fixed".</p>
					<p>The biggest and most notable change is that Rend refunds cooldown AND mana if 1 unit is killed with Rend. This makes it much easier to farm with and less tedious to keep up stacks on multiple creeps early in lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<h5>Karma</h5>
					<p>	W - Fewer damage ticks
					<br>
				 			Empowered E - Lower Shields</p>
					<p>Karma's W, Focused Resolved, is the channeled spell that roots if the channel is completed. This also dealt 3 ticks of damage and helped reduce the cooldown of her ult. This change makes the 3 damage ticks go to 2, which is a minor nerf to Karma.</p>
					<p>The second change is the lowering of base shielding from her Empowered E, Defiance. This mostly impacts her mid-to-late game power, and only shields 30 less, which is not too impactful.</p>
					<p>Karma is still a strong pick against Zilean, and these nerfs won't really tip the scales in Zilean's favor.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<h5>Lucian</h5>
					<p>Passive - Damage Up at early levels
					<br>
							Q - Base Damage Up</p>
					<p>Lucian is a lane bully who gives Zilean a rough time early in lane. These changes give Lucian just a bit more damage in lane, but do not hinder his mobility.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Jungle XP Changes</h5>
					<p>Lower XP for camps on 1st clear</p>
					<p>One of the major problems for bottom lane is how quick a jungler could appear in the bottom lane (with a level advantage) and either secure kills or burn summoners (forcing a more cautious playstyle).</p>
					<p>This is a big deal because it encourages junglers to FULL CLEAR thier jungles from the start to get the camps back to thier full XP value for future clears. This means failing ganks is even more punishing, resulting in fewer ganks/camps.</p>
				</li>

			<h3 id="/patch624">Preseason Patch 6.24</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-624-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.24 is the final patch of 2016 and the last patch before 7.1. This patch is larger than the previous one, but focuses more on "pruning" certain jungle characteristics. There isn't much change regarding the bottom lane directly, except that the major change is that the enemy jungler will not be able to get level 3 off of Red + Krugs (golems) while you are working on your second wave.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Ivern - Weaker Sheilds</span></p>
					<p>Most of the time, you'll run into Ivern in the jungle, but he can uncommonly be played as a support.</p>
					<p>While Ivern support is much much weaker than Ivern jungle, the playstyle is similar: shield allies, connect root for ganks, deny vision with brush.</p>
					<p>The nerfs to his shield increase the mana of each shield (from 50 to 70) and reduce the slowing effect when the shield detonates. This makes it easier to escape and forces Ivern to manage his mana more during long fights.</p>
					<p>Against Ivern, Support Zilean has an edge if playing with an aggressive lane partner. Forcing Ivern support to the turret makes his brush skill useless. With higher mana costs, his shield won't outscale Zilean's Time Bomb (maxing Q of course). And always always always remember to focus down Daisy as soon as possible. She can paralyze your team with constant knock-ups and gradual damage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Kog'Maw - More AD less AP</span></p>
					<p>In recent patches, Kog'Maw was given buffs that powered up the AP Mid Lane Kog, but did little to help out the little guy in the bottom lane.</p>
					<p>In 6.24, Kog'Maw got a 1% increase per rank to his on-hit damage while Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) is active, meaning he is up to 7% maximum health damage at max ranks.</p>
					<p>On the other side, Kog'Maw lost a substantial damage from his Void Ooze (E), lowering the burst power from AP Kog.</p>
					<p>These changes help Kog'Maw in the bottom lane and serve as another alternative to Vayne when dealing with a multi-tank team (while running a protect the Kog comp). Zilean pairs well with Kog (and does well against), so these are welcome changes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/twitch.png" alt="Twitch Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Twitch - Lower Passive Damage</span></p>
					<p>The big change to Twitch is that the Damage over Time from his passive lost 1 damage per stack, capping at 5 damage per stack from 6. This minor adjustment does take away a good chunk of his trading damage.</p>
					<p>The second nerf is that his Venom Cask (W) which procs his passive took a mana increase. Normally, throwing a Cask to zone away the ADC cost little for Twitch, but made a big difference when 2-3 stacks of his passive would be applied without dealing direct damage, and Contaminate (E) dealing a large burst of damage from a safe distance.</p>
					<p>Twitch is tricky for Zilean to deal with (while invisible), but is manageble when you are in range to Double Bomb. Twitch is has very high sustained DPS, so you want to drop the Double Bombs, get some poke with the ADC, and either go in for the kill or back away.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/varus.png" alt="Varus Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Varus - Empowered Passive</span></p>
					<p>The change to Varus' passive, Living Vengeance, increases his attack speed by 25% for 5 seconds when he kills a creep or enemy. The change doubles the attack speed increase if Varus gets a kill or assist.</p>
					<p>This is a small quality of life change to help Varus out, although he is likely to still only see play in the mid lane at higher elo.</p>
					<p>The change to the Varus passive does not change the general dynamic of Varus/Zilean, but serves as a change that may make him more popular to play against the longer ranged ADCs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/vayne.png" alt="Vayne Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Vayne - Reduced Tumble Damage</span></p>
					<p>You may not have seen many Vaynes in your games, but that is probably because she is banned in most Gold+ elo games.</p>
					<p>Vayne was a bit out of control, but the changes take down the total bonus AD into Tumble from a .7 ratio to a .5. Vayne will still hurt, but her damage from Tumble will be much lower as she builds more AD.</p>
					<p>Vayne is a highly favorable matchup for and against Zilean because of Time Warp (E), and this might be enough of a nerf to take her off the permaban list.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/rylais64.png" alt="Rylai's Crystal Scepter Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Rylai's Crystal Scepter - Normalized Slow</span></p>
					<p>Rylai's is a rare buy for Zilean in general, but the nerfs to Rylai's stats and slow do not impact Zilean as much.</p>
					<p>With that being said, Rylai's lost 100hp and 25AP, but took a price cut down to 2600. The most meaningful change is that the old multi-conditional slow is now normalized to 20% in all cases. This means Damage over Time champions will get more value from the Ryali's slow.</p>
					<p>There are some Zilean's that prefer this item (usually in the Top Lane), but it is not a high priority for Support Zilean. These changes greatly harm some of the more oppressive mid lane champions (Azir, Syndra, Leblanc) making it easier to escape if you are caught out.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/res312.png" alt="Courage of Colossus Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Courage of the Colossus - Weaker early game</span></p>
					<p>Courage of the Colossus is a strong initiator mastery that is very strong in the bottom lane (Thresh, Braum, Alistar, Leona, Nautilus). CotC now procs every 45 - 30 seconds (depending on level) and only provides a shield worth 5% of max HP per nearby enemy.</p>
					<p>This change is more impactful to the top lane and jungle, but does take away some of the safety from the bottom lane all-in at level 2 or 3. Once again, if you are in range to Double Bomb the ADC, that will always be your target if you are initiated upon in a 2v2 situation. Once the ADC is stunned, then you can evaluate if you need to pull back or focus down the ADC or support (if the enemy ADC abandons the support).</p>

			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.23 was a very small balance patch that was geared towards beefing up the jungle. Almost every change this patch was directed towards the Mid Lane or the Jungle, and offered little change in the bottom lane. There isn't much to address this patch, so we will wait for the next one and see what changes are in store for us.</p>

			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> As we enter Season 7, Riot has decided to keep things fresh by mixing things up. Normally the jungle is the first thing to be put in the blender, and it has a side of assassins to boot. There were also item updates, mastery changes, and some minor champion updates that impact Zilean in the bottom lane. There's plenty to unpack here, and for more information, visit the dedicated guides for each subject for a more in-depth conversation.</p>
			<div class="quick-guide" id="/622assassin">

				<li>
					<p class=""><span>Assassin Update</span></p>
					<p>Rather than discussing each champion individually, this will be a holistic approach to understanding assassins.</p>
					<p>The goal of an assassin is to eliminate a high value target (ADC, Mid Lane) and quickly escape. For this to work, the assassin needs enough mobility to make it to the target and enough damage to kill the target; extra bonus points if the assassin can escape without dying.</p>
					<p>Zilean has ways to slow down the mobility of assassins (Double Bomb, Time Warp), and can negate fatal damage (Chronoshift), which greatly increases the difficulty of an assassination to the point where the assassin may not even be a factor in the game any longer.</p>
					<p>When an assassin is nearby, your job is to inhibit mobility and prevent the assassination burst damage. If you can do this, you're going to win more games, I guarantee it.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="">Goodbye Pink - Hello Control</p>
					<p>Another overhaul of the preseason is the division between "Camouflage" and "Invisibility".</p>
					<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-camouflage" target="_blank">Camouflage</a> is described as a longer stealth, which includes Evelynn, Twitch, and Rengar's stealths. In short, you can use the Control Ward to reveal the position (similar to the Sweeper Trinket), but not target.</p>
				 	<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-invisibility" target="_blank">Invisibility</a>, on the other hand, is not revealed by Control Wards or the Sweeper Trinket. These are the shorter duration stealths, such as Vayne's ultimate + Tumble or Talon's ultimate. The only way to reveal these effects is true vision from the turret.</p>
					<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-shimmer" target="_blank">Shimmer</a> is a new graphical effect that happens when an invisible or camo unit is damaged. It briefly reveals their position, but does not make them targetable. You can still Double Bomb invisible and camo targets, and now a shimmer effect will happen (along with Time Bomb's detonation animation).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="">Ward Warfare</p>
					<p>In the middle of Season 6, experience rewards were increased for killing wards, and now the experience rewards are increased further. Killing a ward grants 40 experience (or 26xp split between 2 players). This is a little more than an early lane caster minion, plus the vision denial. Just be aware that if the enemy does manage to kill a ward at level 1, they will hit level 2 a minion before you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div>
						<img src="/img/items/aegis64.png" alt="Aegis of the Legion Icon">

					</div>
					<p class="">Aegis of the Legion Items</p>
					<img src="/img/items/aegis64.png" alt="Aegis of the Legion Icon">
					<p>Even though Zilean occasinally built into Aegis of the Legion items, now the team utility of the item has been drastically reduced. Aegis now grants 30 Armor and 30 MR, no bonus health and no Magic Resist Aura. Magic Resist Auras are no longer a thing.</p>
					<img src="/img/items/locket64.png" alt="Locket of the Iron Solari Icon">
					<p>The big change to Locket of the Iron Solari is that the shield is much bigger now. 35+(35 * your level) means a 665 team shield at level 18. The sheild does decay over 2.5 seconds, but it can mitigate some immedate bursts of damage. Overall, this item is OK on Zilean, but shouldn't be mandatory yet. As the professional meta develops, this may become a core item for all supports across the board.</p>
					<img src="/img/items/banner64.png" alt="Banner of Command Icon">
					<p>Banner of Command is no longer an AP item, but a "tank" item. Again, it doesn't have the magic resist aura but it did retain the lane minion promotion mechanic. It builds out of an Aegis and a Glacial Shroud (instead of a Fiendish Codex). I believe this will become an even more situational item for Support Zilean, and Abyssal Scepter will take precedence in the core build order.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/redemption64.png" alt="Redemption Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Redemption</span></p>
					<p>This is an odd item which grants passive health and mana regen, 400 HP and an extra 10% CDR. The activable effect has a 2.5 second delayed beam that heals allies and damages enemies, and this item can be used when dead (OR IF YOU ARE RESSING FROM YOUR OWN ULT).</p>
					<p>This item is incredibly good and many utility based supports are taking this as thier 1st completed item after the upgraded Sightstone. I am also recommending that this is a solid 1st major item to be completed after sightstone.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mikaels64.png" alt="Mikael's Crucible Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Mikael's Crucible</span></p>
					<p>Mikael's Crucible was changed slightly in that it no longer heals when the active is used. Instead, it gives 40% increased movement speed and slow immunity for 2 seconds if a stun/root/taunt/fear/silence/slow was removed. The travel time for the item was removed as well.</p>
					<p>Along with these changes came a cheaper price tag, a buy of only 2100 total gold. There are some minor changes to the stats of this item, but overall these changes are positive for Support Zilean. Crucible is an incredibly powerful utility tool to help someone who is in trouble, and at the expense of the heal, you gain a stronger crowd control cleanse. I still believe this will be a mandatory utility support item.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/knightsvow64.png" alt="Knight's Vow Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Knight's Vow</span></p>
					<p>Knight's Vow is a tanky item that parallels Zeke's Harbinger but with a more defensive focus. Knight's takes some of the damage from your paired partner and redirects it to you. You are also healed by damage your partner does to enemy champions.</p>
					<p>At first glance, this does not look like the best fit for Zilean. Zilean should be OK with letting a teammate get bursted down; as long as Chronoshift is available. This is something to keep an eye out for on the enemy team.</p>

					<p class=""><span>Ancient Coin Upgraded Items - Lower Cost</span></p>
					<p>These two items took a major price reduction (Eye of the Oasis - 2200 -> 1900) and (Talisman of Ascension - 2500 -> 2400). Overall, I am not a fan of the activable upgrades from the starter support items, but the 300 gold off the Eye of the Oasis is quite nice, considering Eye of the Watchers (AP Variant) is priced at 2200 still.</p>
					<p>This means that the choice to start Ancient Coin over Spellthiefs will get you a faster upgraded Sightstone and lower the overall cost of the build (and probably net a more money in the long run). 300 gold is a big deal, especially since I highly recommend starting Tear of the Goddess as a first back item (instead of Sightstone or upgraded starter item).</p>

					<img src="/img/items/zekes64.png" alt="Zeke's Herald Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Zeke's Herald - Lower Cost</span></p>
					<p>Zeke's is an incredible item to pair with Zilean, and now it costs 100 gold less. While this won't make a huge difference in the timing and pricing of builds, it is a little advantage that you can use to empower your ADC sooner.</p>

				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Abyssal Scepter</span></p>
					<p>Abyssal Scepter no longer reduces enemy MR by 20, but increases the magic damage enemies take by 10%. For the most part, this is a pretty welcome change, especially at later stages of the game when subtracting 20 MR still means the enemy has 60% mitigation through MR.</p>
					<p>With some of the item changes, Abyssal Scepter may be more desirable over the recently changed Banner of Command.</p>

					<p>NEW - Fresh Blood</p>
					<p>Your first basic attack against a champion deals an addition 10 + 1  per level (6s cooldown).</p>
					<p>This talent is actually amazing for ranged harass supports. If you do decide to delve into Ferocity, this is probably the talent of choice. Also, watch out for extra damage from enemy supports as well because of this.</p>

					<img src="/img/masteries/fer212.png" alt="Double Edged Sword">
					<p>MOVED - Double Edged Sword</p>
					<p>Your first basic attack against a champion deals an addition 10 + 1  per level (6s cooldown).</p>
					<p>Double Edged Sword now deals an extra 5% damage (taking in 2.5% more) and was moved down into the second keystone tier of the Ferocity tree.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer213.png" alt="Battle Trance">
					<p>NEW - Battle Trance</p>
					<p>Gain up to 5% increased damage over 5 seconds when in combat with enemy champions.</p>
					<p>This seems more reliable for longer engagements and is much safer than Double Edge Sword. But I still do not recommend going this deep into Ferocity for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer311.png" alt="Fervor of Battle">
					<p>Fervor of Battle</p>
					<p>The big change to this is that the damage does much less per hit, but stacks up to 10 (from 8). This is useful to be aware of in lane, because the damage shouldn't be as drastic in early level duels against harass AD Carries, most notably Ezreal.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun211.png" alt="Greenfather's Gift">
					<p>NEW - Greenfather's Gift</p>
					<p>Stepping into brush causes your next attack or ability to deal 3% of your target's current health as bonus magic damage (9s cooldown).</p>
					<p>This is an interesting ability that works for ranged supports who want to get a side brush advantage, and also for junglers.</p>
					<p>As far as damage output goes, it doesn't seem to be that strong. A 600 health target would take 18 damage before magic resist is factored, leading to a peasly 12 damage extra. Of course this scales better into the game, but Bandit should still be the talent of choice for supports.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res113.png" alt="Siegemaster">
					<p>NEW - Siegemaster</p>
					<p>Gain 8 Armor and MR when near an allied tower.</p>
					<p>This is a dynamic talent that you would probably want to take when you know you are against a heavy poke lane and are going to be huddling by your turret.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res213.png" alt="Fearless">
					<p>NEW - Fearless</p>
					<p>Temporarily gain extra Armor and MR when hit by enemy champion.</p>
					<p>This talent isn't good for Zilean since he should not be getting hit, and also his armorMR values shouldn't be that significant. Leave this talent for the tanks.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res312.png" alt="Courage of the Colossus">
					<p>NEW - Courage of the Colossus</p>
					<p>Gain a temporary shield after hitting an enemy with hard CC. This can stack multiple times if multiple enemies are hit with the same CC.</p>
					<p>CotC replaced Strength of Ages, so no need to worry. This talent makes certain champions formidible in the mid to late game, most notably Alistar. This talent is best left for initiators, which Support Zilean should not be.</p>

					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Alistar - Skill mixup</span></p>
					<p>Passive: Alistar now heals when he has 7 stacks of Triumphant, which are gained from minions dying and applying CC to enemy champs.</p>
					<p>Pulverize (Q) - No longer stuns after knock-up ends.</p>
					<p>Trample (E) - Damages units around every 0.5 seconds. Every enemy hit by Trample gives Alistar a stack. At 5 stacks, Alistar's next auto deals extra damage and stuns for 1 second.</p>
					<p>Unbreakable Will (R) - No longer gains extra AD during ultimate.</p>
					<p>These changes make Alistar harder to play now. His W+Q Combo now has less CC time, and needs to be paired with E in order to make up for the lost stun time from Q.</p>
					<p>Alistar is a fairly easy matchup for Zilean, so increasing the difficulty for that champion only helps Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/twitch.png" alt="Twitch Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Twitch - Mechanics Change</span></p>
					<p>Ambush (Q) - Now provides Camouflage for a longer duration, and gains bonus MS when near enemy that can't see him (or when there isn't a Control Ward around).</p>
					<p>Venom Cask (W) - The Cask leaves a cloud for 3 seconds that causes stacks of Deadly Poison.</p>
					<p>These changes don't do too much to change the playstyle of Twitch, only update him into the new Camouflage paradigm for Season 7.</p>
				</li>

					<img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Ivern - Better buff Ivern</span></p>
					<p>Rootcaller (Q) - Lower CD and made it easier for Ivern to jump to his target.</p>
					<p>Daisy! (R) - More health, higher intelligence.</p>
					<p>Ivern got another round of buffs, which is increased his winrate in the jungle. In the bottom lane, Ivern is pretty tricky to play against. You have to pay attention if he leaves lane, he may be trying to sneak away a jungle camp.</p>
