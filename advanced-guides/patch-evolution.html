		<h3>State of Zilean Support - Season 7</h3>
		<div class="content-container">
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<h4>Support Zilean Tier Ranking (7.12): C</h4>
					<p>The changes to the core utility items really did a number on Zilean. Right now, he is in a very bad spot with regards to utility builds. The AP build is till ok, but performs worse at higher elos (less opportunities to be a damage carry from support).</p>
					<p>It may take some time for Zilean to find an identity through items in this patch, but I'll be sure to let you know what's on the horizon.</p>
					<h5>Enemy champions to watch out for:</h5>

						<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
						<img src="/img/champion/caitlyn.png" alt="Caitlyn Icon">
					</div>
					<p>These are the champions to watch out for because they have large range and great poke damage and give Zilean a hard time during lane.</p>

			<h3 id="patch711">Patch 7.12</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-712-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
					<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.12 brings several changes to the support item choices to make things more diverse. Unfortunately, all of the tuning doesn't look that great for Support Zilean, at least on paper.</p>
					<p>Big nerfs include Redemption, Locket, Karma's Shield, and Doran's Shield.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/redemption64.png" alt="Redemption Icon">
					<h5>Redemption</h5>
					<p>Lower Base Heal, Higher %Heal Scaling
					<br />Lower Health, Higher Mana Regen</p>
					<p>Redemption is much worse off as a stand-alone item, but works better when you have several items that increase healing.</p>
					<p>This change gives more value to Stoneborn Pact Zilean, but doesn't offer a ton to the base build of Zilean and is a flat nerf.</p>
					<p>In short, this item is not the best one to rush any longer. Getting this as your 3rd or 4th item is not a bad idea.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/locket64.png" alt="Locket of the iron Solari Icon">
					<h5>Locket of the Iron Solari</h5>
					<p>Lower Shield, Scales with BONUS health</p>
					<p>Locket is now changed to work better with tanks or champions that add extra HP to thier build. Normally, you'd get about an extra 400hp with Sightstone and Redemption.</p>
					<p>At max level, you will lose out on about 90 extra shielding at max level (665 => 578).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon">
					<h5>Athene's Unholy Grail</h5>
					<p>Stats Changed, Better with Mana Regen</p>
					<p>Athene's Unholy Grail is one item that could be somewhat viable for Support Zilean now (when paired with Ardent Censer and Stoneborn Pact). The big thing is that you get 5AP for every 25% mana regeneration you have, which can add another 20-40 AP depending on your build.</p>
					<p>Another appealing thing about this item is that it only costs 2100g, making it one of the least expensive finished items for supports.</p>
					<p>Finally, if you pair Ardent Censer + Athenes + Redemption, you have a much stronger heal from Redemption. This build is known as the "enchantress" build because it is very strong with Karma.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="/zekes-convergence">
					<img src="/img/items/zekes64.png" alt="Zeke's Convergence Icon">
					<h5>Zeke's Convergence</h5>
					<p>Item Rework</p>
					<p>This item is a strange one. It offers 60 armor, 30 magic resist, 250 mana and 10% CDR. The item did have a price increase to 2400g and builds out of a Aegis of the Legion now.</p>
					<p>The big change is the passive which activates when you cast your ultimate (and is on a 45sec cooldown). You get a cloud that surrounds you, and your ADC has auto attacks that deal extra magic damage. If you both auto the same target, they take extra damage.</p>
					<p>My first impression of this item is that it is incredibly clunky with Zilean. The best use of this item looks to be defensive, but Zilean has more than enough CC tools to disengage already.</p>
					<p>RIP Zeke's Harbinger.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/banner64.png" alt="Banner of Command Icon">
					<h5>Banner of Command</h5>
					<p>Different Build Path</p>
					<p>Banner now builds out of Raptor Cloak and doesn't give 400 mana any longer. You do get the passive movespeed around turrets now, but the price is unchanged.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/knightsvow64.png" alt="Knight's Vow Icon">
					<h5>Knights Vow</h5>
					<p>10% CDR, No Health Regen</p>
					<p>The components for this build were changed to now take a Kindlegem instead of a Crystalline Bracer. This is great because it gives Zilean a little bit of CDR if you choose to buy this item.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/glacial64.png" alt="Glacial Shroud Icon">
					<h5>Glacial Shroud</h5>
					<p>-5 armor
					<br />100g Price Drop</p>
					<p>This is a little change to this item that makes it easier to get, but the items that build out of it are now just <a href="#zekes-convergence">Zeke's Convergence</a>, Frozen Heart, and Iceborn Gauntlet. Those items don't seem that appealing, but there are some quirky tricks you can do with Iceborn Gauntlet and Stoneborn Pact.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<h5>Corki</h5>
					<p>Basic Attacks : 80% Magic, 20% Physical</p>
					<p>Corki is now going back to being the good old AP threat in the past, instead of a balance of AP and AD. The difference is that he will still want to build AD, but take AP penetration items, such as Void Staff over Last Whisper later in the game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<h5>Jhin</h5>
					<p>(Q) Dancing Grenage - Lower Base Damage, Higher AD Ratio
						<br />(R) Curtain Call - Higher Base Damage
					</p>
					<p>Jhin is getting a few buffs to make his mid and late game stronger, but still make his early laning pretty tough. If Jhin snowballs early, it's going to be a very tough game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<h5>Karma</h5>
					<p>(E) Inspire - Lower Shielding at Higher Ranks<br />
						(R+E) Empowered Inspire - 30% Shield to Others</p>
					<p>Karma takes a big hit to her shield this patch, making her much less potent in the late game. The big change is to her empowered shield.</p>
					<p>Karma can still be a bully in lane, especially if she is maxing Q first.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/malzahar.png" alt="Malzahar Icon">
					<h5>Malzahar</h5>
					<p>(Q) Call of the Void - Lower Damage<br />
						(R) Nether Grasp - Lower Damage and QSS No Longer Breaks Damage</p>
					<p>Malzahar hasn't seen much love in the botton lane since the most recent change to his Voidlings, and these nerfs make it pretty clear that Riot wants Malz to be in the mid lane.</p>
					<p>Malzahar does even less damage and needs a decent amount of AP to make a difference. But to compensate, they are making the damage from Nether Grasp not go away the second QSS is activated. So you have to Flash away to stop the damage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/xayah.png" alt="Xayah Icon">
					<h5>Xayah</h5>
					<p>(Q) Double Daggers - No Autos During Spell<br />
						(W) Deadly Plumage - Longer Cooldowns (+4 seconds)</p>
					<p>Xayah is one of those champions that can really get out of hand if she gets ahead. Her damage is strong, and there are plenty of small things that you can do to up the damage by a little.</p>
					<p>These changes will lower her damage output, but you still have to be very careful about positioning against Xayah, and even more-so when she is paired with Rakan.</p>

			<h3 id="patch711">Patch 7.11</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-711-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.11 is a smaller patch with a couple of more mini-reworks and nerfs to some of the stronger champions. In the bottom lane, the only changes were to the support items, Maokai, Lulu, and Rakan.</p>
			<p>This patch should feel better for Support Zilean than the last one.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ancient_coin64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<h5>Ancient Coin Line</h5>
					<p>Price Drop: 25g</p>
					<p>The Ancient Coin support items are considered the worst of the three possible starting items, and now we're seeing subtle buffs to help the item out.</p>
					<p>The 25g reduction doesn't offer much, but it's the little things that build up over time that can make this item great again. If the Coins in lane were easier to get, or it offered some sort of healing to offset the poke damage you take, then this item will be good again.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/banshee64.png" alt="Bannshe's Veil Icon">
					<h5>Banshee's Veil</h5>
					<p>Price Increase - MR Increase</p>
					<p>Banshee's Veil has been one of my favorite items on Support Zilean as of late because it offers so many things that Zilean loves. CDR, MR, AP, and a spellshield to fend off picks, this item is an incredibly strong defensive buy.</p>
					<p>The price hike is validated by the 60 Magic Resist the item now provides. This makes this the second highest MR item in the game, only 5 MR behind Abyssal Scepter. The extra 300g does hurt though, and makes this item much harder to complete on the support budget.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/caitlyn.png" alt="Caitlyn Icon">
					<h5>Caitlyn</h5>
					<p>Passive - Headshot Interaction</p>
					<p>Caitlyn is one of the hardest AD Carries for Zilean to lane against, and any nerfs are welcome.</p>
					<p>This nerf applies to her passive, specifically shots added from Hurricane counting towards her Headshot. This is a pretty significant nerf, meaning that her damage in group fights will be much lower.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<h5>Lucian</h5>
					<p>(Q) Piercing Light - Increased Mana Cost (+5 mana per rank)</p>
					<p>The increased mana costs will shorten his uptime of skill chaining for maximum DPS. In lane at level 5, each Q will be 10 more mana than previously, which should lower his damage if he hasn't been back to buy in some time.</p>
					<p>This is a minor change that constricts his ability to "go all out just one last time".</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/maokai.png" alt="Maokai Icon">
					<h5>Maokai</h5>
					<p>Passive - Better w/ HP scaling<br />
						(E) Sapling Toss - Lower Scaling, Lower Duration</p>
					<p>Support Maokai is one of those "fool me once" champions where you figure out the novelty, then you play around it.</p>
					<p>The nerfs try to peg Maokai into being a better tank, rather than being a Sap Spammer with heavy AP.</p>
					<p>Now, the damage reduction ONLY targets his AP scaling, meaning that his saplings will still do a truck load of damage, but it will fall off in the late game.</p>
					<p>The nerf to the duration of Saplings means that with an extra 1,000HP, Saplings will only last 55 seconds (as opposed to 70 at max rank). It shouldn't be as dangerous to face-check dangerous areas and get ambushed by renegade saplings, but don't let your guard down.</p>

			<h3 id="patch710">Patch 7.10</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.10 is a smaller patch with a couple of more mini-reworks and nerfs to some of the stronger champions. In the bottom lane, the only changes were to the support items, Maokai, Lulu, and Rakan.</p>
			<p>This patch should feel better for Support Zilean than the last one.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ancient_coin64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<h5>Ancient Coin Line</h5>
					<p>Buffs to fundamentals</p>
					<p>The Ancient Coin items were by far the weakest of the three support items, but offered probably the best reward.</p>
					<p>Changes include a 25% health regen bonus on all of the upgraded items, and coins 100% drop off cannon minions.</p>
					<p>The biggest change was now it provides a +1 to level, instead of just an extra skill point that doesn't go beyond your skill level. Previously I had mistaken the previous iteration to the current one, so now everything makes more sense on why you would even want this item.</p>
					<p>I still agree that this item has a long way to go before it will be good for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Spellthief Edge Icon">
					<h5>Spellthief's Edge Line</h5>
					<p>CS penalty reworked</p>
					<p>The big change is that instead of disabling your Tribute passive when you take a CS, now the passive is paused, meaning you can still proc the stacks on tribute if you have them.</p>
					<p>This is a big improvement for AoE champions, like Zilean, who accidentally take CS when trying to land poke or Double Bomb enemies standing by minions. This means that you should be able to get your Spellthief's Edge quest done even quicker.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/maokai.png" alt="Maokai Icon">
					<h5>Maokai</h5>
					<p>(E) Sapling Toss - Lower Base Dmg & Higher Mana Costs</p>
					<p>If you've played against a Maokai support, you will find it incredibly oppressive if he takes control of the side bushes.</p>
					<p>The big change is that Sap Toss now costs more mana, has lower base damage but does a higher % of health at earlier ranks.</p>
					<p>The playstyle doesn't change, just that the sapling spamming should take more thought with regards to mana/resource management.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<h5>Lulu</h5>
					<p>(E) Help Pix - Lower Shielding<br />
					Lower base health</p>
					<p>Lulu has been on the top banned list for some time now, and these are some minor nerfs that will chip away with her effectiveness.</p>
					<p>The lower health and lower shield output means that she will be more fragile and susceptible to poke.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/rakan.png" alt="Rakan Icon">
					<h5>Rakan</h5>
					<p>Enhanced Abilities</p>
					<p>Rakan got a series of much needed nerfs. This champion is a blast to play, but has a rough time in the early game.</p>
					<p>First is the buff to his Q. The range was increased to 900, which is the range that Zilean can throw Time Bomb.</p>
					<p>His W (the dash/knockup) now has extra damage with more ranks, but it isn't too significant.</p>
					<p>The final change is a nerf to his shield, with lower shielding at higher levels. This is a pretty big nerf, seeing that his shielding is such an important part of his kit come late game.</p>
					<p>Overall, these changes should make Rakan's laning phase easier for him and tougher for opponents. Zilean shouldn't have much of a problem against him.</p>
				</li>

			<h3 id="patch79">Patch 7.9</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-79-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.9 is the Mid-Season patch which changed a handful of tanks, added and changed several defensive items, and overhauled the support items.</p>
			<p>The changes to support items greatly reduced the power of Support Zilean and make it much more difficult for him. In short, all of the support items have a quest where you use your support item for extra gold. Once you have enough bonus gold, you get a special reward from the item. Unfortunately, all of the rewards are bad for Zilean, or come way too late in the game.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ancient_coin64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<h5>Ancient Coin</h5>
					<p>Complete Rework<br />
					Reward: 1 Free Skill Point</p>
					<p>Ancient Coin no longer provides passive gold when a minion dies, but each minion that dies has a chance to drop a coin on the ground (visible to teammates and enemies). Every other coin gives 20 gold, or a small amount of mana back. When you collect enough gold from this item, you get an elixir that gives a free skill point.</p>
					<p>This item no longer gives back health when a minion dies and no longer has passive mana regeneration.</p>
					<p>The problem with this item is that the coins that spawn from the minions can be in awkward spots. Enemies can zone you away from coins until they despawn, or easily predict your movements and deal extra damage when you go for them.</p>
					<p>Needless to say, you don't get much money from this item, meaning the quest reward is postponed late into the game, beyond the point where it would be useful. In the games that I have played, the coin quest is usually finished between 17 and 20 minutes.</p>
					<p>This item is now for champions with sustain, sheilds or Rakan.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<h5>Spellthief's Edge</h5>
					<p>Complete Rework<br />
					Reward: Bonus Movespeed on Damage</p>
					<p>Spellthief's Edge is the same as before, but has some of the stats changed. For instance, there is less mana regeneration as the item is upgraded, but the AP from the item is increased. The passive was changed so that taking a CS puts a 6-second pause on using its passive, with each creep killed adding 6 more seconds to the pause.</p>
					<p>The reward from this item gives 50% bonus movespeed for 1 second after dealing damage, which isn't good with Zilean because his damage is delayed from Time Bomb, or your spell rotation is cast and the movespeed is unnecessary.</p>
					<p>Of the 3 items, this is the best pick. It's the best for winning lane, but offers very little as the game goes on. You don't have to upgrade this item right away, and in some cases you can end up selling this item and getting something else.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/banshee64.png" alt="Banshee's Veil Icon">
					<h5>Banshee's Veil</h5>
					<p>Now a DPS Item</p>
					<p>Banshee's Veil is now an AP item with 70AP and 10% CDR. It also has 45 Magic Resist and the same old passive shield that blocks a spell.</p>
					<p>This is a pretty OK late-game defensive item that Zilean can get once his Core Build is complete.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<h5>Abyssal Scepter</h5>
					<p>Now a Tank Item</p>
					<p>Abyssal Scepter was changed to benefit AP tanks, like Amumu. The passive that causes enemy champions to take extra magic damage is still there.</p>
					<p>Abyssal now has 300 health and 65 maguc resist, along with the old 10% CDR. This item is better suited for tanks, so I don't think this is a good purchase for Support Zilean anymore.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/guardian_angel64.png" alt="Guardian Angel Icon">
					<h5>Guardian Angel</h5>
					<p>Now an AD Item</p>
					<p>Guardian Angel was changed to only give 30 armor and 40 AD, which makes it terrible for non-AD champions. The passive was changed to return a champion with 50% base health, so tanks and bruisers get shafted.</p>
					<p>Do not buy this item on Zilean anymore. It's not good for you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/maokai.png" alt="Maokai Icon">
					<h5>Maokai</h5>
					<p>Rework - Many Changes</p>
					<p>Maokai was changed in this patch and has been a strong support pick because of the changes to his Sapling and Ultimate.</p>
					<p>Maokai can throw saplings in a side brush, which grow and deal extra damage. He maxes them first to do more damage, which makes it painful to lane against if Maokai has brush control.</p>
					<p>His ultimate now throws a slow moving wave down the lane which has a long root, but this is easy for Zilean to avoid with his mobility.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.8</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-78-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.8 is a small patch that didn't do much to change the bottom lane meta, aside from introducing another pair of champions! Right now I'm going to hold off my analysis of these two until I've had a patch to play with and against them.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/rakanxayah.jpg" style="width:560px !important;height:145px !important;" alt="Rakan and Xayah">
					<h5>Xayah and Rakan</h5>
					<p>NEW CHAMPIONS</p>
					<p>These two champions were released together in 7.8. I'm going to hold off on analysis for these two champions until at least 7.9, after I've had some time to see how these champions are.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/malzahar.png" alt="Malzahar Icon">
					<h5>Malzahar</h5>
					<p>Void Swarm (W) - Lower Health</p>
					<p>It looks like Riot wants to put an end to Malzahar support once and for all. The most recent nerf lowers the HP of Voidlings from 3 to 2, but lowers their gold value from 10 to 5.</p>
					<p>This means that killing the Voidlings is going to be very easy, especially in a lane where ADC and Support can auto the Voidling 1 time each and prevent any more from spawning.</p>
					<p>Malzahar also lost 2 base armor, putting him in the same spot with most of the AP mages.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nautilus.png" alt="Nautilus Icon">
					<h5>Nautilus</h5>
					<p>Lower Mana Regen
					</br>Riptide (E) - Mana Increase</p>
					<p>Nautilus Support has become a fringe pick, and these nerfs do not help it at all. The lowering of his already strained mana pool make it even harder for him to cast multiple rotations in lane.</p>
					<p>The increased mana cost to his E makes it much harder for him to trade, since this is primarily what most Nautilus' (both top and support) max first.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.7</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-77-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.7 is another small intermission patch. There were some pretty substantial changes to Amumu, but he isn't typically a support (but still read the patch notes if you haven't). There aren't many playstyle changes to be aware of for Support Zilean in this patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<h5>Alistar</h5>
					<p>Passive - AoE Healing
					<br>Trample - Lower Cooldown and Higher Damage</p>
					<p>Alistar is getting some changes to make him similar to his previous versions (before his E and passive were changed). Alistar's healing works better in group settings instead of just during lane with the passive change.</p>
					<p>The lowering of the cooldown on his E just makes it so most of his cooldowns line up nicely for combos and the damage boost is nice, but the current meta is very unfriendly towards melee supports. I don't expect to see much Alistar in the meta unless there is a shift away from ranged/mage supports.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/bard.png" alt="Bard Icon">
					<h5>Bard</h5>
					<p>Passive - Charms</p>
					<p>Bard got an overhaul for his charms, where the bonus damage for collecting charms fixed at +15 damage per 5 charms. Bard can also store up to 9 empowered auto attacks (up from 3). This still requires plenty of work getting charms, but places higher priority on the Charm-finding sub-game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/galio.png" alt="Galio Icon">
					<h5>Galio</h5>
					<p>Passive - Lower Damage
					</br>Winds of War (Q) - AP Changes</p>
					<p>The extra damage from Galio's passive was lowered, especially at higher levels.</p>
					<p>The change to Winds of War make it more rewarding for AP, but has lowered % health damage. Even though support Galio is an uncommon pick, this makes his poke and combo much less powerful.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jinx.png" alt="Jinx Icon">
					<h5>Jinx</h5>
					<p>Flame Chompers! (E) - Lower Cooldown</p>
					<p>The lowering of cooldown at higher ranks should help Jinx's utility during the later game where her traps are her only way to create distance from enemies (aside from killing them).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lux.png" alt="Lux Icon">
					<h5>Lux</h5>
					<p>Final Spark (R) - Cooldown Refund on Kill</p>
					<p>If Lux kills a target with Final Spark, a % of the cooldown is refunded to Lux. This doesn't offer too much to support Lux because her AP usually doesn't get out of control and she builds enough CDR so that the refund wouldn't be as powerful.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.6</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-76-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.6 a smaller patch that looks to improve certain champions that were changed in 7.5. Again, this is a much lighter patch and there aren't many significant changes to the match-ups.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/galio.png" alt="Galio Icon">
					<h5>Galio</h5>
					<p>Champion Rework</p>
					<p>The concept of Galio is to be a magic resist tank, but now his kit plays similarly to Shen. As of writing this, his numbers look fine for solo lane, but he will probably be lacking the durability of the support tanks (Nautilus, Alistar, Braum).</p>
					<p>Playing against a Galio support means you will want to have higher mobility to punish him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/fiddlesticks.png" alt="Fiddlesticks Icon">
					<h5>Fiddlesticks</h5>
					<p>Terrify - Increased Range</p>
					<p>Way back in patch 6.9, the range on Fiddle's Fear was reduced from 575 down to 525. Now in 7.6, the range is being reverted to 575.</p>
					<p>The big deal is that now Fiddle's Fear outranges most of the ADC/Support auto attack ranges. He will have a safer time getting the fear off without taking an auto attack before the point-and-click Fear.</p>
					<p>Does this mean Fiddlesticks will become a meta support again? Unlikely.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/missfortune.png" alt="Miss Fortune Icon">
					<h5>Miss Fortune</h5>
					<p>Double Up - Higher Damage and Flexible Range
					</br>Make It Rain - No longer stops to cast</p>
					<p>Double Up took a major hit last patch, and Riot believes she has atoned for her misgivings. On top of a damage increase, Double Up now can have increased range with Rapid Fire Cannon. This is a positive change since Miss Fortune is being directed towards the Essense Reaver/Crit build rather than the Lethality/Black Cleaver build.</p>
					<p>The second change is the Make It Rain change which is an expensive spell used to escape or pin down enemies. The change makes it easier for MF to keep chasing down people (but doesn't do much for running away). Again, this spell is taxing on the mana and this change should only help Miss Fortune catch up to slowed targets slightly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/quinn.png" alt="Quinn Icon">
					<h5>Quinn</h5>
					<p>Heightened Senses (W Passive) - Increased attack speed
					</br>Valor Form - Lower damage upon exiting</p>
					<p>Quinn doesn't see much play in the bottom lane, but these changes do affect this markslady.</p>
					<p>Quinn's burst came from jumping on someone, then deleting them through several Harrier triggers. Now the damage is being shifted out of the intial burst from Quinn and moved to higher attack speed with Harrier active.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/varus.png" alt="Varus Icon">
					<h5>Varus</h5>
					<p>Piercing Arrow - Flat Cooldown when Triggering Blight</p>
					<p>In 7.5, Varus had an awkward time with Piercing Arrow triggering Blight, which gave a variable amount of cooldown on the spell. The more CDR you had, the lower amount triggering Blight gave.</p>
					<p>So Riot tossed that system out and now just give a 4-second bonus cooldown reduction when Blight is triggered from Piercing Arrow.</p>
					<p>Does this make Varus all better again? No. There are still many marksmen ahead of him.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer311.png" alt="Warlords Bloodlust Icon">
					<h5>Warlord's Bloodlust</h5>
					<p>Lower Values</p>
					<p>Warlord's Bloodlust went up to 50% lifesteal at max ranks, and now returns up to 40% of your total AD. If the hit that procs Warlords crits, the heal will crit as well.</p>
					<p>The first thing this does is makes this talent useful ONLY for AD champions, and even better for those who build heavy AD. Since the values moved from Lifesteal to a % of your attack damage, the numbers aren't going to be affected by Lethality, Armor, or base damage modifiers (Draven Spinning Axe, anyone?).</p>
					<p>For the most part, this will give lower healing against most targets, while being more consistent against targets. For marksmen, this is should be the go-to pick for Crit builds (whereas Lucian/Ezreal still benefit most from Fervor).</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.5</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-75-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.5 is yet another nerf patch aimed at reducing the power of the most banned champions in the game: LeBlanc, Rengar, Ryze and Varus. On top of that, Edge of Night took another nerf.
			<br>The biggest change for Support Zilean are the mastery changes, which introduces a brand new mastery that works very well with the utility support Zilean build.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<h5>Lucian</h5>
					<p>Cast Time Changes on Q and W</p>
					<p>Lucian is one of the harder matches for Zilean due to his mobility, and this doesn't change too much. It will be harder to dodge his Piercing Light (Q) later in lane, but his damage numbers remain the same.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/missfortune.png" alt="Miss Fortune Icon">
					<h5>Miss Fortune</h5>
					<p>Lower damage on Q</p>
					<p>Miss Fortune was another ADC who could abuse Lethality, especially with her Double Up. The changes lower the damage output of Q's second hit, but now it can crit. This means that the Essense Reaver -> Crit builds should become more prominent if there are any Miss Fortune ADC players left after these nerfs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/varus.png" alt="Varus Icon">
					<h5>Varus</h5>
					<p>Piercing Arrow - Lower damage, longer CD</p>
					<p>Varus is yet another victim of the Lethality nerfs, and also is taking a hit to his kit. The extra scaling that comes from charging Piercing Arrow was slightly reduced (165% -> 150%) and an extra 4 seconds were added to Q as well.</p>
					<p>There was a compensation buff for Varus in that landing a Q against a target with Blight (his passive) will give a 4sec reduction on his Q. This means that Varus should be looking to weave auto attacks instead of just barraging from a long distance.</p>
					<p>Along with the Lethality item nerfs, this will likely knock Varus out of the S-Tier ADCs and someone else will take his spot.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/edgeofnight64.png" alt="Edge of Night Icon">
					<h5>Edge of Night</h5>
					<p>5 Second Spellshield</p>
					<p>Edge of Night recieved some hotfix changes in 7.4 (lower AD, longer CD) and this is yet another nerf lowering the safety and damage output this item provides.</p>
					<p>Edge of Night still may be a go-to item for certain assassins, but it may not be as valuable on ADCs because of the shorter duration on the spellshield.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res313.png" alt="Stoneborn Pact Icon">
					<h5>Stoneborn Pact</h5>
					<p>Your CC grants a short HoT to allies who attack a CC'ed champion</p>
					<p>Ok. This is new, and I really really like it with a pure utility build.</p>
					<p>In short, every CC you land creates a rune on the target(s) for 4 seconds. If an ally damages them, they get a heal over 2 seconds. The heal doesn't stack, but the buff is refreshed when damage is dealt to a runed target.</p>
					<p>For a much longer conversation, you can check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZileanMains/comments/5ybvla/support_zilean_stoneborn_pact_great_or_meh/" target="_blank"> the Reddit Thread</a> which has a much more in-depth look at this.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer311.png" alt="Warlords Bloodlust Icon">
					<h5>Warlord's Bloodlust</h5>
					<p>Energize Concept Change</p>
					<p>Warlord's Bloodlust now has an energized effect (similar to Static Shiv) where moving around and auto attacking increases the stacks. At 100 stacks, your energized attacks have extra Lifesteal and movement speed.</p>
					<p>Many marksmen will likely take advantage of this talent because it helps with mobility and sustain. It also stacks up pretty quickly (I believe around 4-5 autos).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer313.png" alt="Deathfire Touch Icon">
					<h5>Deathfire Touch</h5>
					<p>Bonus AD ratio reduced</p>
					<p>This doesn't impact Support Zilean much, but matchups like Jhin, Varus, and Miss Fortune are not going to be as strong with this mastery.</p>
					<p>Just be aware that these marksmen may opt for a different mastery, like Warlords Bloodlust.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/etc/exhaust.png" alt="Exhaust Icon">
					<h5>Exhaust</h5>
					<p>No longer reduces Attack Speed, Armor, MR</p>
					<p>That's right, Exhaust is not as strong anymore, but is still likely to remain the staple for bottom lane due to the 40% damage reduction and 30% slow.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.4</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-74-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.4 is another major balance patch which changes aspects of the game: from the lowering of damage from masteries, to XP and gold changes to First Blood and First Tower Blood, to changes to several items. And of course, we have champion buffs and nerfs. This is one of the more significant patches, and I strongly recommend reading the actual patch notes, as these notes will be focused on how Support Zilean is impacted.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<h5>First Tower Blood</h5>
					<p>400g -> 300g</p>
					<p>First tower is one of the most sought after bonuses for ADCs in the game, and often falls around level 5 or 6 with the help of a jungler tower dive. The reduction in bonus gold makes it so that there isn't a massive gold difference between opposing enemy ADCs (with the victor having a mere 550g difference if the ADC is the only one in range when the tower dies).</p>
					<p>The level 5 and 6 ganks will still come for Support Zilean, but the payoff for taking that first turret isn't as valuable as before. If you have the opportunity to down the enemy tower, by all means, destroy it.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">

					</div>
					<h5>Mastery Changes</h5>
					<p>Most of the mastery changes for this patch reduce the percentage bonus damage for several skills in the Ferocity Tree. There are also some changes to the Precision mastery in the Cunning Tree, but Support Zilean always takes the extra CDR talent.</p>
					<p>While these mastery changes do not directly impact your selection for which masteries you choose, these changes to lower the damage output of other players in the game. This means your team is a little less strong, but your enemies are also a little less strong too.</p>
					<p>These changes are minute in single instances, but add up for the total damage overall throughout the game.</p>
					<p>Regarding bottom lane, the nerf of Warlords and buff of Fervor of Battle should enhance the abilities of the mid-range auto-attack reliant Marksmen. I expect to see an increase on Lucians in the bottom lane, a match-up that Zilean does very poorly into.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun22.png" alt="Mastery Icon">
					<h5>Mastery Change - Meditation</h5>
					<p>1.5% -> 1.25%</p>
					<p>A minor change to Support Zilean is the mana regeneration nerf from Meditation going from 1.5% to 1.25%. This shouldn't be too much of an impact against Zilean considering that your build will likely include at least 2 mana regneration items and 1 mana item.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/bard.png" alt="Bard Icon">
					<h5><span>Bard</span></h5>
					<p>More Movement Speed from Passive</p>
					<p>Bard is going to be much quicker in 7.4, making his roams much harder to punish. Against your lane, this means that your window for punishing a 2v1 is lessened by about 2-3 seconds (assuming he just roams to the closest 2 charms in his jungle).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<h5><span>Jhin</span></h5>
					<p>Shorter Slow Duration on Ultimate</p>
					<p>Dodging Jhin ultimates isn't too difficult for Zilean. But getting tagged by a single bullet could spell disaster. The slow duration changing from .75 seconds to .5 means that you have a better chance of dodging the longer range bullets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div>
						<img src="/img/items/controlward64.png" alt="Control Ward Icon">
						<img src="/img/items/oracles64.png" alt="Sweeper Icon">
					</div>
					<h5>Control Ward / Sweeping Lens / Duskblade</h5>
					<p>No Longer Disable Traps</p>
					<p>This change is significant in that you can no longer throw down a Control Ward or hit your Sweeper to disable Jhin traps, Teemo Mushrooms, or Shaco Boxes. You can still be hit by those nasty devices if you go in range.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.3</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-73-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.3 is a major balance patch that is serving out many nerfs to some of the strongest champions on the rift. The hit list includes the following: Camille, Jayce, Kha'Zix, LeBlanc, Malzahar, Rengar, Vi and Zyra. For the purpose of this guide, I will only be focusing on the bottom lane matchups and not the impact of the other champions in other roles. But this should be a glorious day where many of these "overpowered" champions were toned down.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/malzahar.png" alt="Malzahar Icon">
					<h5><span>Malzahar</span></h5>
					<p>W - Delay on cast</p>
					<p>Support Malzahar was one of the more annoying picks of 7.2, but a decent matchup for Zilean.</p>
					<p>The previous playstyle for Malzahar to mash his W to quickly get the voidlings out, forcing whoever the target is to run away. By adding a delay there is more of a time for players to react and not get trampled.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<h5><span>Zyra</span></h5>
					<p>Plants Don't Auto Focus Nearby Champs
					<br>Q - Higher Mana Costs</p>
					<p>One of the issues with Zyra is that she could use her plants triggered by Q to zone out and poke marksmen trying to get CS at the back of thier minion wave. The problem was that the plants would focus the closest enemy champion and continue to focus until the champion leaves the attack range.</p>
					<p>This makes the Zyra lane much less punishing in lane. She is still extremely dangerous if you are out of position, but her poke damage will be contingent on landing her spells.</p>

			<h3>Patch 7.2</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-72-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> 7.2 for Support Zilean can be summed up into a single point: Redemption nerfs (and it isn't as bad as you'd think). The trend of standard supports was to rush this item as soon as possible, but now it is OK to postpone this item a little longer. The nerf is painful for Zilean because the item was so strong, however this is a nerf across the board and not a direct hit on Zilean. Let's be honest here, Redemption is still strong but needed the early game power toned down.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/redemption64.png" alt="Redemption Icon">
					<h5><span>Redemption</span></h5>
					<p>Lower Health (400 -> 300)
					<br> Increased Mana Regen (75% -> 125%)
					<br> Heal nerfed for early game</p>
					<p>The big and most important change is the reduction of the heal. This change affects the early game usage by having a low base value that scales with levels, but ultimately has the same value as before at level 18.</p>
					<p>In a non-snowballed game, Zilean SHOULD be a higher level than the enemy support, which gives Redemption a little bit more umph over the other team.</p>
					<p>For a more in-depth discussion, you can check out the <a href="//www.reddit.com/r/ZileanMains/comments/5pywqs/redemption_nerf_and_you/" target="_blank">Zilean Redemption Reddit Thread</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/edgeofnight64.png" alt="Edge of Night Icon">
					<h5>Lethality</h5>
					<p>40 / 60 Ratio Reversed</p>
					<p>Lethality is the new armor penetration where the total amount is split between flat armor penetration and level-based penetration/ The old formula was 40% base, 60% scaling, but now it is the opposite; 60% base and 40% scaling.</p>
					<p>Many marksmen favor this item in lane which makes thier damage incredibly high without armor. Since supports and ADCs do not typically buy armor for some time in thier builds, lethality item rushes are potent for crushing lane.</p>
					<p>Another item of note is the Edge of Night. This item produces a spellshield that absorbs the 1st spell. This will negate the first bomb in a Double Bomb combo.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<h5>Lulu</h5>
					<p>Passive - Smoother Damage
					<br> Q - Lower mana costs</p>
					<p>Lulu was in a rough spot after a series of nerfs that forced her out of the solo lanes and back to the bottom of the map. The damage nerfs also made it questionable to max Q first, and instead max the shield, acting as a weaker version of Janna.</p>
					<p>This is a step to make Lulu more potent in the bottom lane. Lately, Lulu has been seen as a direct counter to Malzahar Support because a single auto from her is enough to pick off a Malzahar Voidling (which is a major part of his damage pre-6).</p>
					<p>Lulu is a tough match for Zilean, but these buffs don't swing Lulu into an overpowered state, thus the playstyle shouldn't change.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Jungle Changes</h5>
					<p>Later Spawns</p>
					<p>The jungle is still being perfected, and this latest iteration changes the spawn times of the Red or Blue off back to 1:40 (as it was in Season 6). You'll want to toss your bomb at 1:37 or 1:38 to make sure it detonates when the mob spawns.</p>

			<h3 id="/patch71">Patch 7.1</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-71-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 7.1 is the first patch of 2017 and is one of the minor balance patches.</p>
			<p>Things have gotten a bit weird over the past month without balance changes or LCS, and there is an emergence of AP mages in the bottom lane taking the place of ADCs. The current meta is awkward with ADCs being ineffective at almost every stage of the game.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/draven.png" alt="Draven Icon">
					<h5><span>Draven</span></h5>
					<p>Q - Stronger Spinning Axe
					<br> W - Lower Mana Costs</p>
					<p>Draven's Spinning Axe now comes with a base damage and also scales off of <span>BONUS</span> AD, when before it was based off of TOTAL AD (without any extra base damage). Draven will hit much harder earlier on, making extended trades treacherous.</p>
					<p>The second effect is that his movement speed buff (that refreshes when he catches an axe) has lower mana costs with ranks, meaning Draven may not need to build Essense Reaver to cope with his mana problems.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kalista.png" alt="Kalista Icon">
					<h5>Kalista</h5>
					<p>E - Rend improvements</p>
					<p>Kalista's Rend has some problems before, stacks wouldn't accumulate when Rend was on CD, the reset on Rend not triggering, and the awkward 2-kills to refund the mana.</p>
					<p>Now that has been changed: the spears DO accumulate if Rend is on CD and the bug where Rend wasn't resetting was "fixed".</p>
					<p>The biggest and most notable change is that Rend refunds cooldown AND mana if 1 unit is killed with Rend. This makes it much easier to farm with and less tedious to keep up stacks on multiple creeps early in lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<h5>Karma</h5>
					<p>	W - Fewer damage ticks
					<br>
				 			Empowered E - Lower Shields</p>
					<p>Karma's W, Focused Resolved, is the channeled spell that roots if the channel is completed. This also dealt 3 ticks of damage and helped reduce the cooldown of her ult. This change makes the 3 damage ticks go to 2, which is a minor nerf to Karma.</p>
					<p>The second change is the lowering of base shielding from her Empowered E, Defiance. This mostly impacts her mid-to-late game power, and only shields 30 less, which is not too impactful.</p>
					<p>Karma is still a strong pick against Zilean, and these nerfs won't really tip the scales in Zilean's favor.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<h5>Lucian</h5>
					<p>Passive - Damage Up at early levels
					<br>
							Q - Base Damage Up</p>
					<p>Lucian is a lane bully who gives Zilean a rough time early in lane. These changes give Lucian just a bit more damage in lane, but do not hinder his mobility.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Jungle XP Changes</h5>
					<p>Lower XP for camps on 1st clear</p>
					<p>One of the major problems for bottom lane is how quick a jungler could appear in the bottom lane (with a level advantage) and either secure kills or burn summoners (forcing a more cautious playstyle).</p>
					<p>This is a big deal because it encourages junglers to FULL CLEAR thier jungles from the start to get the camps back to thier full XP value for future clears. This means failing ganks is even more punishing, resulting in fewer ganks/camps.</p>
