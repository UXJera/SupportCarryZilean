				<h1>Tear vs No Tear</h1>
				<p>Tear of the Goddess is a mana item that is one of most controversial buys for Support Zilean. For most cases, you will either back with enough gold to buy this as your first item or not at all.</p>
				<p>Many Support Zilean mains are on the fence if Tear is worth the buy. On the plus side, you get to cast many more spells and the item holds value throughout the game.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, you are investing 750g which delays your Sightstone and your first completed item. Not to mention that there are many items that provide mana regen (and mana in the case of Morellonomicon).</p>
				<p>This guide is going to go in-depth into mana, mana management, regen, and item slot efficiency. I would recommend either thinking about your ideal 5-item build or visiting <a href="" target="_blank">"What to Buy and When"</a> so can have an idea of how all of Zilean's items work together for the purpose of this article.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span>Price: </span>750g</li>
						<li>Provides 250 Mana on Purchase</li>
						<li>Refunds 15% Mana on all spells cast</li>
						<li>Stacks up to 1000 Mana</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Tear of the Goddess is a 750g item that provides a 250 mana and grants an additional 4 maximum mana when you cast a spell (with a short cooldown). Additionally Tear also refunds 15% of your mana spent, effectively increasing your total mana pool by 15%</p>
			<p>In order to fully stack Tear, you need to cast 188 spells. Zilean is at an advantage with this because his spells are on a short cooldown and are constantly chained together. If you were to time your spells perfectly to optimize Tear, it would be complete after 12 and 1/2 minutes. Most of the time, it takes around 20 minutes to fully charge.</p>
			<p>Tear also builds into Archangel's Staff and transforms into Seraph's Embrace once Tear is fully charged. But the upgrade comes at a hefty price: 2350g or 1100g + Needlessly Large Rod. The general concensus is that upgrading Tear into Archangel is done only when you have run out of items to buy and are stockpiling money.</p>

			<h3 id="/laning">The First Back</h3>
			<p>Buying the early tear requires you to invest your first 750g on your first back. If you don't have the cash up front (by backing around level 4 or dying in lane), then it is best to start with your Tier 2 gold generation item (as it provides a good amount of mana regen).</p>
			<p>Once you have the tear, your spells become less costly and you can safely use your spells for poking without having to be afraid about conserving enough mana for Double Bombs + Chronoshift. This combo costs 300 mana, and Zilean's level 6 mana pool is base 598, meaning you ideally would want to be conserving half of your mana to dump at any given time. The Tear reduces the mana cost by 15% (300mana -> 255mana) and also provides you with 250 more mana, which would pay for the combo by itself. The concept of reserving your mana and holding back spells is called "pooling".</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content-container">
			<h4>Spell Affordance and Pooling</h4>
			<p>Spell Affordance is a fancy way of saying "Do you have mana in order to cast all of your spells?". If you don't, typically it means you should either back soon or play completely passively to pool your mana in order to cast spells again.</p>
			<p>Pooling is the concept of conserving your mana by not casting spells or casting sparingly. Before your first buy, pooling is an essential part of Zilean's kit where you have to manage your mana conservatively or else you won't be able to cast enough spells to secure a kill or escape from trouble.</p>
			<p>Pre-6, you want to pool about 190 mana, which is enough for a Double Bomb combo and a Time Warp. Post 6, you want to conserve anywhere between 200-300 mana (depending on how low you and your ADC are and the chance that you will get 4-man dove).</p>
			<p>Zilean's spells work best in combos, meaning that you are likely to use anywhere from 130 to 250 mana in a single spell rotation. Chronoshift is an additional 125 to 175 mana, which is the most valuable of Zilean's spells. If someone dies and you have your ultimate, expect your team to be upset with you.</p>
			<h4>Pooling with regards to items</h4>
			<p>When you don't buy Tear, you have a lower mana pool but higher regeneration, which means that you recover more mana over a long period of time. For instance, at level 5 you have more mana available with a Tier 2 support item through mana regen after 8 waves than you would have with a Tear.</p>
			<p>Buying Tear allows you to cast many more spells than the Tear-less build simply by having a more mana available. More mana means more spells to be cast, which means you have the freedom to cast liberally instead of saving spells for the exact moment.</p>
			<p>One of the most important questions you need to ask yourself before opting to buy a Tear or not is reflecting on how you play Zilean.</p>

			<h3 id="/#playstyle">Playstyle Differences</h3>
			<p>Zilean is one of the few supports that can get away with spamming out his spells and be immune to being punished. You can speed boost yourself around the map high speeds for the low cost of 135 mana. If you miss your target on Double Bombs, you have created a zone where enemies won't go because of the stun. With enough CDR and mana, you can spam Zilean's spells and there is no real negative for it.</p>
			<p>I play Zilean as a mage that can zone away enemies, zoom around the map, and always have enough mana to Chronoshift someone who gets caught. I have the ability to push lane with 2-3 spells (and running next to 0 AP).</p>
