				<h1>Tear vs No Tear</h1>
				<p>Tear of the Goddess is a mana item that is one of most controversial buys for Support Zilean. There are many Zilean mains who say Tear is one of the best items for Zilean and always buy it. There are other Zilean mains who say the item is useless and never buy it.</p>
				<p>Is Tear good or bad for Support Zilean? This is a subjective topic that <span>YOU</span> have to decide for yourself. The choice comes down to your personal playstyle.</p>
				<p>Some Zileans play with Tear and win often.</p>
				<p>Some Zileans play without Tear and win often.</p>
				<p>The power of Tear or No-Tear comes down to <span>HOW</span> you play the game. Of course, there are positives and negatives to Tear of the Goddess, and this guide should help you evaluate if Tear is the right buy for your playstyle.</p>

		<h3>What does Tear of the Goddess do?</h3>

				<h4>Tear of The Goddess</h4>
				<div class="tear-img">
					<img src="/img/items/tear-big.png">
				</div>
				<div class="tear-list">
					<ul>
						<li><span>Price: </span>750g</li>
						<li>Provides 250 Mana on Purchase</li>
						<li>Refunds 15% Mana on all spells cast</li>
						<li>Stacks up to 1000 Mana</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Tear of the Goddess is a 750g item that provides a 250 mana and grants an additional 4 maximum mana when you cast a spell (with a short cooldown). Additionally Tear also refunds 15% of your mana spent, effectively increasing your total mana pool by 15%</p>
			<p>In order to fully stack Tear, you need to cast 188 spells. Zilean is at an advantage with this because his spells are on a short cooldown and are constantly chained together. If you were to time your spells perfectly to optimize Tear, it would be complete after 12 and 1/2 minutes. Most of the time as Support Zilean, it takes around 20 minutes to fully charge.</p>
			<p>Tear also builds into Archangel's Staff and transforms into Seraph's Embrace once Tear is fully charged. Archangel's provides 150 AP at level 18 (only calculating the mana from Zilean's base stats + the mana from Archangels). The mana refund is bumped to 25%, and Archangel's provides an activatible damage shield.</p>
			<p>Upgrading to Archangel's does come at a hefty price: 2350g or 1100g + Needlessly Large Rod. The general concensus is that upgrading Tear into Archangel is done only when you have run out of items to buy and are stockpiling money.</p>

				<p>* The two values on mana cost reflect the mana cost on Rank 1 Time Bomb and Rank 5<br>
				** A complex revival chain that uses mobility to get in range to ultimate, Rewind to reset Time Warp (if you need to escape), Double Bomb on top of the revived player, then Time Warp to get the revived person out.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Zilean is heavily reliant on quick combinations of spells to make a difference. The divergence on whether you want Tear or not depends on the number of spells you use in a period of time.</p>
			<p>If you depend on casting spells to make your impact (zoning, map mobility) in the game or play proactively "fishing" for Double Bombs, then you want to buy Tear of the Goddess ASAP.</p>
			<p>If you play more traditional supports who only use the right spells at the right time by playing reactively, you are less likely to need Tear.</p>
			<p>Zilean's spells are on a fairly low cooldown, and thus playing around a gap between Double Bombs is hard to punish. The way Zilean can be punished is by exploiting his mana pool.</p>
			<p>Zilean gets the most out of his spells by chaining them together, which often means that a regular spell combo will take a minimum of 150 mana. If you have a mana pool of 600 mana, this means you can only cast 4 Double Bombs before you would run out of mana (not factoring mana regen).</p>

			<h3>Mana Pool vs. Mana Regeneration</h3>
			<div class="tear-pros-cons-container">
				<div class="tear-pros-cons tear-pro">
					<h4>Mana Pool</h4>
					<img src="/img/items/tear-big.png">
					<ul>
						<li>Larger mana pool and spell cost reduction</li>
						<li>Access to more spells over a short period of time</li>
						<li>Better for extended teamfights and sieges</li>
						<li>Peace of mind that you won't run out of mana</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tear-pros-cons tear-con">
					<h4>Mana Regen</h4>
					<img src="/img/items/no-tear-big.png">
					<ul>
						<li>More efficient for longer periods of time</li>
						<li>Similar mana management as other supports</li>
						<li>Better for item slot efficency</li>
						<li>Works just fine if you manage your spells and mana well</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Having a large mana pool means that you have more spells to use over a shorter period of time. Tear does a fantastic job increasing your mana pool and lowering your spell costs, giving you access to a large amount of spells in a short period of time.</p>
			<p>On the opposite end, regeneration (non-Tear) builds work with a smaller mana pool, but have enough mana recovery for extended periods of time. If you aren't casting spells as often, you will have enough mana available to cast all of your spells during a teamfight.</p>
			<p>For most supports, it is easy to manage mana efficiently because only a portion of their spells are usable outside of combat. Zilean plays much differently, with him casting multiple spells to outside of combat for utility purposes (Q-W-Q for zoning, E-W-E for map mobility).</p>
			<p>Buying Tear helps your get through the early and mid game nicely, but once you have a critical mass of around 200% mana regeneration from items, the regeneration is enough to offset your mana usage in most cases. Until that point, without Tear, you have to be careful with how many spells you use in an exchange/teamfight. This means you have to exercise "Mana Pooling".</p>
			<h4>Spell Affordance and Pooling</h4>
			<p>Spell Affordance is a fancy way of saying "Do you have mana in order to cast all of your spells?". If you don't, typically it means you should either back soon or play completely passively to pool your mana in order to cast spells again.</p>
			<p>Pooling is the concept of conserving your mana by not casting spells or casting sparingly. Before your first buy, pooling is an essential part of Zilean's kit where you have to manage your mana conservatively or else you won't be able to cast enough spells to secure a kill or escape from trouble.</p>
			<p>I value having more Spell Affordance (being able to cast as many spells as I want, unconditionally), but there are many Zilean mains that cast spells sparingly and save mana for the important times.</p>
			<p>The weakness of Tear builds is that it delays your core support items and takes up an item slot. For some, this is enough of a playstyle shift to just stick with what has worked with them.</p>
			<p>Try both. Buy the early Tear some games, and see if you like it. If you already buy Tear, try living without it for a few games to see if you like that playstyle (I promise, it is a much different experience).</p>

			</div>
			<p>The laning phase is the hardest part of the game for Support Zilean. He has long cooldowns, runs out of mana quick, and has limited utility.</p>
			<p>The difference in early laning difference between Tear or not is pretty significant. On one hand, you start with a larger mana pool. On the other, you have higher gold generation, better regeneration, and an easier path into the mid game.</p>
			<h4>The First Back</h4>
			<div class="tear-pros-cons-container">
				<div class="tear-pros-cons tear-pro">
					<h4>Buy Tear</h4>
					<img src="/img/items/tear64.png">
					<ul>
						<li>More than 750g on first back</li>
						<li>Ahead or even in lane</li>
						<li>Better for aggressive play</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="tear-pros-cons tear-con">
					<h4>Upgrade Gold Item</h4>
					<img src="/img/items/nomad64.png">
					<ul>
						<li>Less than 750g on first back</li>
						<li>Behind in lane</li>
						<li>Better for  passive / reactive play</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Buying the early tear requires you to invest your first 750g on your first back. If you don't have the cash up front (by backing around level 4 or dying in lane), then it is best to start with your Tier 2 gold generation item (as it provides a good amount of mana regen).</p>
			<p>Once you have Tear, your spells become less costly and you can safely use your spells for poking without having to be afraid about conserving enough mana for Double Bombs + Chronoshift. This combo costs 300 mana, and Zilean's level 6 mana pool is base 598, meaning you ideally would want to be conserving half of your mana to dump at any given time. The Tear reduces the mana cost by 15% (300mana -> 255mana) and also provides you with 250 more mana, which would pay for the combo by itself.</p>

			<h4>Playing the lane with Tear</h4>
			<p>When you return to lane with Tear, your enemy will have a laning advantage from an upgraded support item or building into a Sightstone. The advantage from Tear comes from the amount of extra spells you can cast.</p>
			<p>This makes your mana pool less exploitable, meaning more crowd control from Zilean. You can fish for Double Bombs (Q-W-Q) without much consequence for missing. You can E forward to intimidate enemies back. This means you can play more aggressively as long as you don't misposition or take too much damage in trades.</p>
			<p>However you do miss out on some crucial items if you buy Tear with only 750g; you have no extra mana for potions or a Control Ward. It's a gamble to return to lane without sustain or a static piece of vision (since we are delaying Sightstone by a few minutes). You can work around the potion issue by buying a Refillable Potion at the start of the game. With Ancient Coin, you have enough sustain where you shouldn't need the extra potion.</p>

			<h4>Laning Without Tear</h4>
			<p>Laning without Tear on first back is similar to the playstyle from 1-5. You have to be careful with how many spells you throw out. The only difference is that you get a little more mana regeneration by upgrading your support item.</p>
			<p>Since you will almost always base with over 500 gold, upgrading your item is possible in nearly every situation where you don't die before level 3. Any extra gold can be used for more potions, a Control Ward, or even a Ruby Crystal if you did well enough in lane.</p>
			<p>If you normally play with Tear, going back to lane with an upgraded support item feels bad. You don't have as much control, since you have limitations on how many spells you can cast. You have to be very careful on which engages you go for, how long you stick around in a fight, and how often you through single bombs for poke.</p>

			<p>When you are regenerating mana, you don't have as many opportunities to poke or throw bombs to bait out enemy spells (Janna shields, Lucian dashes, Ezreal blinks). Gradually wearing down your opponents HP and Mana pool is a laning goal, and with Tear you have more resources at your disposal to deplete the enemy. If the enemy support is out of mana, the number of things they can do is drastiaclly limited.</p>

			<h4>Why you DON'T Buy Sightstone First</h4>
			<div class="tear-img-small">
				<i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				<img src="/img/items/sightstone64.png">
				<i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			</div>
			<p>Unless you are playing in the LCS or a high elo 5's team, there is no reason to buy Sightstone as your first item. You should have sufficient vision between you and your partner's wards, along with watching the minimap to see where the jungler might be.</p>
			<p>Sightstone provides you with 3 wards that last 2 and 1/2 minutes. Your trinket ward lasts a little over 1 minute and has 2 charges. Your lane partner will also have trinket ward, meaning that you can keep a high uptime of vision in a single bush.</p>
			<p>Also, Control Wards cost 75g and last until killed. If you are playing the lane right, you can have the Control Ward provide enough vision to keep you safe from ganks.</p>
			<p>And don't forget that you can use Time Bomb for vision into brushes.</p>
			----
			<p>Buying Tear does set your build back 750g, which is almost the price of a Sightstone (which means you skip upgrading your gold generation item and buy the Sightstone instead). Non-Tear build can buy the Tier 2 gold generation item, then quickly rush the Upgraded Sightstone and be able to have a Forbidden Idol (+50% mana regen, 10% CDR) by the same time Tear builds finish their Upgraded Sightstone.</p>

			<p>In the same vein as the laning phase, the mid game can be summarized by having more mana versus having quicker items. If you are used to casting lots of spells, the Tear is still the better option in the mid game. If you are more accustomed to traditional supports, then these items will feel more comfortable to you.</p>
