				<h1>Tear vs No Tear</h1>
				<p>Tear of the Goddess is a mana item that is one of most controversial buys for Support Zilean. For most cases, you will either back with enough gold to buy this as your first item or not at all.</p>
				<p>Many Support Zilean mains are on the fence if Tear is worth the buy. On the plus side, you get to cast many more spells and the item holds value throughout the game.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, you are investing 750g which delays your Sightstone and your first completed item. Not to mention that there are many items that provide mana regen (and mana in the case of Morellonomicon).</p>
				<p>This guide is going to go in-depth into mana, mana management, regen, and item slot efficiency. I would recommend either thinking about your ideal 5-item build or visiting <a href="" target="_blank">"What to Buy and When"</a> so can have an idea of how all of Zilean's items work together for the purpose of this article.</p>

		<h3>What does Tear of the Goddess do?</h3>

				<h4>Tear of The Goddess</h4>

				<div class="tear-list">
					<ul>
						<li><span>Cost: </span>750g</li>
						<li>Provides 250 Mana on Purchase</li>
						<li>Refunds 15% Mana on all spells cast</li>
						<li>Stacks up to 1000 Mana</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Tear of the Goddess is a 750g item that provides a 250 mana and grants an additional 4 maximum mana when you cast a spell (with a short cooldown). Additionally Tear also refunds 15% of your mana spent, effectively increasing your total mana pool by 15%</p>
			<p>In order to fully stack Tear, you need to cast 188 spells. Zilean is at an advantage with this because his spells are on a short cooldown and are constantly chained together. If you were to time your spells perfectly to optimize Tear, it would be complete after 12 and 1/2 minutes. Most of the time, it takes around 20 minutes.</p>
			<p>Tear also builds into Archangel's Staff and transforms into Seraph's Embrace once Tear is fully charged. But the upgrade comes at a hefty price: 2350g or 1100g + Needlessly Large Rod. The general concensus is that upgrading Tear into Archangel is done only when you have run out of items to buy and are stockpiling money.</p>

		<h3>Spell Affordance and Pooling</h3>
		<div class="content-container">
			<div>
				<p>Spell Affordance is a fancy way of saying "Do you have mana in order to cast all of your spells?". If you don't, typically it means you should either back soon or play completely passively to pool your mana in order to cast spells again.</p>

		<h3><img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Icon"> Time Warp - E</h3>
		<div class="content-container cdr-container">
			<a href="/img/tables/cdr-e-table-lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/img/tables/cdr-e-table.jpg" alt="Time Warp (E) CDR Table"></a>
			<div>
				<p>Time Warp has no cooldown scaling with level and is entirely dependent on your items for Cooldown Reduction.</p>
				<p>Time Warp has the longest refresh cycle of all of the primary skills, making CDR vital if you plan on using Time Warp often (which I highly recommend).</p>
				<p>The big breakpoint here is at 30% CDR, where the refresh rate goes to 10.5 seconds. This means that you can use slow on an enemy, cast the first Time Bomb, Rewind (which will reset Time Warp's cooldown to 0), cast the second Time Bomb (stun), then land another slow.</p>
				<p>Even though 35% guarantees that Time Warp will be completely reset by Rewind, you should never try to quickly double slow, but wait until the first slow is almost done, then cast the second, meaning that the extra CDR isn't absolutely necessary in this case.</p>
				<p>As the game goes on, you want to have Time Warp on the lowest cooldown as possible. It can be used as an engage tool for the tank, a disengage if someone tries to run up, a pick tool if someone is out of position, or an escape tool to get two members of the team out fast.</p>
				<p>The lowest refresh cycle for this spell is 8.2 seconds, which means that you will have to wait 8.2 seconds AFTER you cast it the second time while Rewind is on cooldown. In most cases, it is OK to use the Rewind when there are about 4-5 seconds on the refresh cycle of Time Warp to ensure that you get the spell off.</p>

			<div>
				<p>In general, the longer the spell refresh, the more you will get out of Cooldown Reduction.</p>
				<p>Before the Zilean rework of 2015, Zilean's ultimate was affected by Rewind's 10 second cooldown reduction, meaning this spell could almost always be up every 20-30 seconds. However, with enough CDR, you can get close to the same results with a 33 second refresh cycle on Chronoshift.</p>
				<p>This is huge because in longer teamfights, you should be able to get 2 or 3 of these spells off.</p>
				<p>Ranking up Chronoshift gives 25% base CDR per rank, which takes a spell from a 2 minute refresh to a 1 minute refresh. Toss in CDR from the build and you are looking at an ultimate that is up every 33-39 seconds.</p>

		<h3>35% vs 45% CDR</h3>

			<a href="/img/tables/35-vs-45-cdr.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/img/tables/35-vs-45-cdr-sm.jpg" alt="Comparing 35% vs 45% CDR on spells"></a>
			<div>
				<p>Starting off, it is assumed that you are taking the 5 points in the Intelligence Mastery which will give you another 5% CDR, seeing as there are no other good alternatives for masteries.</p>
				<p>The philosophy behind taking 35% CDR comes from the mid lane, where you can be granted the Blue Buff which adds an extra 10% CDR, which makes CDR efficiency being either inefficient for 2 minutes (with max CDR from items) or CDR efficient for 2 minutes (only building 30% CDR from items).</p>
				<p>This table is more relevant for Zileans who are playing mid lane, to help optimize their builds.</p>
				<p>For support, it is extremely unlikely that you should ever be given Blue Buff, and should be priorities to the AD Carry before you.</p>
				<p>Looking into the numbers, you only gain under 1 second of cooldown on Time Bomb and Rewind, but 6 seconds on the ultimate.</p>
				<p>Most could argue that fractions of seconds are trivial, but as a caster who should constantly be casting to zone out enemies, or have an ultimate available most of the time, hitting the CDR is asset to your overall utility.</p>

			<h3>CDR and Max Skill Order</h3>
			<p>This is the part where we get philosophical about skill order and spell cycles.</p>
			<h5><img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Icon"> Maxing Time Warp</h5>
			<p>When you start maxing Time Warp, you are doing it because of the slow and speed up, even though you do not get any cooldown from increasing ranks.</p>
			<p>By picking up early CDR, you are able to cast more Time Warps, but also get lower times on Time Bomb, which at rank 1 has a 10 second cooldown.</p>
			<p>When Time Bomb is at Rank 1 and you have 25% CDR, you effectively have the same cooldown as Rank 5 with 0% CDR, meaning that the CDR greatly assists the number of Double Bombs that you can toss out.</p>
			<h5><img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Icon"> Maxing Time Bomb</h5>
			<p>By taking extra ranks into Time Bomb early, you get the base 20% CDR at Rank 5, along with the extra damage and slightly longer stun.</p>
			<p>The extra CDR affects Time Warp well, since ranks do not lower the spell's cooldown any further.</p>
			<p>Looking at just CDR and low spell cycles (without accounting for the utility of Time Warp), maxing Time Bomb will result in shorter spell cycles.</p>
