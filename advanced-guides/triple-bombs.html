			<h3>What is a Triple Bomb, and how is it different from a Double Bomb?</h3>
			<p>A Triple Bomb is where you are able to land 3 bombs onto a single target by delaying the cast of Time Bomb while refreshing Rewind on cooldown.</p>
			<p>A Double Bomb is where you quickly cast Time Bomb and Rewind and immediately recast Time Bomb to get a quick stun before the enemy can react. This is the most common and used combination of Time Bomb.</p>
			<h6><span>Triple Bomb: </span> Q + W -> (2.25 sec delay) Q -> W (on cooldown) -> Q</h6>
			<h6><span>Double Bomb: </span>  Q + W + Q</h6>
			<p>For most purposes, the Double Bomb is the superior combination, because it has a higher likelihood of connecting with a stun. The Triple Bomb (and subsequent Chain Bomb) is better for fights that are stationary.</p>

			<h3>How exactly does a Triple Bomb / Chain Bomb work?</h3>
			<p>Chain Bombing works when you have Rewind at a high enough rank and enough CDR that the cooldown on Rewind will come up about half a second after the full duration of Time Bomb.</p>
			<p>What this means is that if you hold your the Time Bomb that will trigger the detonation until the final 1/4 of Time Bomb's duration (.75 seconds), you will be able to cast Rewind and have Time Bomb up again for another detonation.</p>
			<p>You can chain together a maximum of 7 Time Bombs with perfect mechanics, but it is extremely difficult and is impractical for standard gameplay.</p>

			<h3>What do I need to do a Triple Bomb or Chain Bomb?</h3>
			<p>To do a Triple Bomb or Chain Bomb, you need these 3 requirements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><h5>&bull; 5 Ranks into Rewind (W)</h5></li>
				<li><h5>&bull; A minimum of 25% CDR</h5></li>
				<li><h5>&bull; A target that you can multiple Time Bombs onto</h5></li>
			</ol>
			<p>5 Ranks into W brings its cooldown to 6 seconds (before cooldown). The only other breakpoint is 4 Ranks W and 45% CDR, which is the same value as 5 Ranks W with 25% CDR. This means that it's easier and reasonable to expect at least 25% CDR by the time W is maxed (at level 13).</p>
			<p>The earliest possible point to use a Triple Bomb is with 25% CDR and max ranks, which gives Rewind a 4.5 second cooldown. You will have to land the detonation bombs perfectly or else the combo will fail.</p>
			<p>With higher CDR, the window is more forgiving, and you can chain together several bombs. Additionally, if you stand closer to the Time Bomb, your travel distance will be shorter, and you will have more lenience with detonation times. For a chart that shows the precision timings for different CDR ranges, here is the <a href="//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGQYakbzmBKtlXn2ejUeNCe1x5lVr6Bla1DjvrKdU8I/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheet</a> that goes into the timing detail.</p>
			<p>The final point is that you need a suitable target. This is the tricky part because enemy minions die quickly, keeping up with enemies isn't always possible, and allies may die before you get too many re-detonations off.</p>
			<p>Realistically, you can probably get away with a Triple Bomb, and have it be very effective by casting the third Time Bomb quickly, but eliminating the possibility of more chain bombs.</p>
			<p>Also, it takes significant concentration to Chain Bomb, because the timing window is precise and landing bombs on moving targets is tough. You could easily find yourself out of position because you were watching the Time Bomb detonation ring too closely.</p>
