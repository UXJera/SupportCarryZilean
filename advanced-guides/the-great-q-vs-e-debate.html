			<h1>The Great Q vs E Debate</h1>
			<p>Zilean is a unique support mage that has drastically different playstyles depending on which skill you max first. There are a few champions that are similar: Karma, Lulu, and Soraka to a degree. These champions have an offensive poke skill that you typically max first, but you can max the defensive skill and heavily empower your ADC with utility.</p>
			<p>Since this is a debate, there are several categories which one spell is better than the other. Each category focuses on the strengths of the spell at certain points in game.</p>
			<p>The big thing to consider when choosing what to max, you’ll want to make your decision on a number of factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What type of lane are you playing against? (The most important factor)</li>
				<li>Does your Marksman follow up well better with poke or CC?</li>
				<li>Will your jungler be willing to come to your lane?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span>TL;DR:</span> Time Bomb is more fun and better for solo play, Time Warp is much stronger in group play and is incredibly oppressive.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
		<div class="content-container">
			<h3>Playstyle</h3>
			<p>In every situation, you have the option to either max Time Bomb or Time Warp and will work out in every game, but there are times when one is more beneficial than the other.</p>
			<p></p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>More aggressive playstyle</li>
						<li>Solid poke damage with single Time Bomb</li>
						<li>Safe trades with long range and delayed damage</li>
						<li>Has 1v1 potential with proper skill usage</li>
						<li>More powerful zoning in choke points with Double Bombs</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>More passive and defensive playstyle</li>
						<li>Great for punishing mispositions and roams</li>
						<li>Requires assistance from other players to get kills</li>
						<li>Better map mobility, so easier to get high impact wards down</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: This is your call. <img src="/img/skills/QE64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>This decision is a huge player preference. Some players may play more defensive, passive, and reactionary, which means that Time Warp is the better option. Some players want to damage and kill enemies, so Time Bomb is the better choice for them.</p>
				<p>I've had great success maxing either skill, and there are certain lanes where I want to play reactively, and lanes where I want to play aggressively.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
    <div class="content-container">
			<h3>Laning Impact</h3>
			<p>Laning is the point in the game where you stay by your ADC and help him CS and stay alive.</p>
			<p>Choosing to max Time Bomb or Time Warp means a drastic difference on how you play the lane.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Better to play when not queued with a bottom lane partner</li>
						<li>Great for wearing down enemy laners</li>
						<li>Can help push out waves quickly</li>
						<li>Plays aggressively by tossing out spells to poke enemies down</li>
						<li>Can deny enemies CS by using the high damage to zone enemies</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Better for coordinated play (jungle and/or marksman)</li>
						<li>Great for punishing enemy laners' mispositioning</li>
						<li>Fantastic gank support with jungler</li>
						<li>Plays passively and waits for all-in opportunities</li>
						<li>Great for getting one person out of danger</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Bomb <img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>For the majority of people, maxing Time Bomb is the best option.</p>
				<p>Zilean can be a lane bully if you trade damage effeiciently, and get an early lead for your lane, and this doesn't require any communication with your team and is easy to identify and follow up with.</p>
				<p>Time Warp is better if you have a Marksman who is communicating with you, so you can coordinate all-ins by initating with a Time Warp slow, then follow up with Double Bombs, and another Time Warp slow at the end. If your Marksman can put out some decent damage, or if there is only 1 laner there, you will easily get a free Flash or kill.</p>

			<h3>Mana Consumption</h3>
			<p>Spells cost resources, and the more resources you have, the more you can expend.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>60 – 80 mana per cast</li>
						<li>155 – 175 mana per spell cycle (only bombs)</li>
						<li>You use this spell more often because of the poke damage</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>50 mana per cast</li>
						<li>205 – 255 mana per spell cycle (using 1 or 2 slows with double bombs)</li>
						<li>You use this combo less often because you wait for enemy misposition</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Warp <img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>Even though the overall spell combo costs more for Time Warp, you will be using it far less often than throwing out Double Bombs.</p>
				<p>Mana preservation is much easier to do with cheaper Time Bombs and being calculated on when you decide to strike.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
		<div class="content-container">
			<h3>Cooldown</h3>
			<p>Cooldowns are how often your spells will be available again after casting.</p>
			<p>To get a deeper read into the exact numbers behind cooldown reduction, you can read the article <a href="/advanced-guides/cdr-and-you.html">CDR and You.</a></p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>10 second base cooldown that scales with ranks</li>
						<li>Minimum CD of 4.4 seconds</li>
						<li>Spell cycle of 4.4 seconds with 1.1 sec delay (at max CDR)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>15 second base cooldown that does NOT scale with ranks</li>
						<li>Minimum CD of 8.2 seconds</li>
						<li>Spell cycle of 8.2 seconds with 4.9 sec delay (at max CDR)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Bomb <img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p> The base cooldown of Time Warp is static throughout ranks, while you get passive cooldown with ranks in Time Bomb.</p>
				<p>All of Zilean’s skills work great with CDR, so this shouldn’t be a deciding factor since you should be aiming for a quick 45% CDR, regardless of which skill you max.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
		<div class="content-container">
			<h3>Damage</h3>
			<p>Damage is self-explanitory, but does not define Zilean's kit.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>At rank 3, you get a decent spike dealing 120+ damage per bomb with 0 AP</li>
						<li>At rank 5, you deal 300 per bomb to minions, and about 220 to champions</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>The base damage on your bombs will be ~50-60 until you hit level 14</li>
						<li>The damage is very low, but you get stronger CC</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Bomb <img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>Time Bomb does the more damage, no question about it, but it doesn’t always guarantee a kill.</p>
				<p>The 3 second countdown on the Time Bomb gives plenty of time to use Heal or have support intervention.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
		<div class="content-container">
			<h3>Crowd Control</h3>
			<p>Crowd control is one of the biggest assets to Zilean's kit. Your choice is between longer stuns or more potent slows.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Base of 1.1 second stun, up to 1.5 seconds</li>
						<li>AoE CC, so the more targets the better</li>
						<li>Bomb smart-targeting prioritizes enemy champions</li>
						<li>Tricky skillshot stun on lower cooldown</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>The base duration is 2.5 seconds, the longest single slow behind Nasus’ Wither</li>
						<li>Single target CC, but can be cast twice to affect 2 targets</li>
						<li>Can be chained together for 5 seconds of 99% slow (along with 1.1 seconds of stun)</li>
						<li>Consistent point-and-click guaranteed slow at 550 range</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Warp <img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>The pure lockdown on maxed Time Warp oppressive, with a maximum of 5 seconds of near immobilization.</p>
				<p>The only real difference you get from rank 1 Time Bomb and rank 5 is an extra .4 seconds of stun at the expense of a point-and-click 99% slow.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Spell Utility</h3>
			<p>Spell Utility can be described as the impact that the spell that benefits the team.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Great for zoning out choke points or cause enemies to walk a longer path</li>
						<li>Can cause enemies to back off if they have 1 bomb on their head</li>
						<li>Pushes out lanes quickly if there is low wave clear on the team</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Can speed up an ally by 99% MS or slow an enemy by 99%</li>
						<li>Great pick tool, can causes flashes to be burned at Rank 3 (70% slow)</li>
						<li>Near perma 600+ movement speed to get around to ward and out of bad situations</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Warp <img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>Time Warp can help you get around the map quick and get the critical vision, get you out of scary chases, or speed up your main engage champion to force a fight.</p>

			<h3>Mid Game Impact</h3>
			<p>The Mid Game impact usually refers when you are around level 9 to 10 and are grouping as a team.<p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Good for zoning out enemies</li>
						<li>Helps with wave clear</li>
						<li>Good AoE damage in teamfights</li>

				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Great for catching people out of position</li>
						<li>Amazing peel for your ADC</li>
						<li>Consistent and reliable single-target effect</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: Time Warp <img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>The slow from Time Warp is so punishing, plus having the speed to zip around and set up ward lines is so valuable.</p>
				<p>Hands down this the better mid game spell because of its versatility.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-wrapper">
    <div class="content-container">
			<h3>Teamwork</h3>
			<p>The Teamwork metric depends on if you want to carry yourself or empower others to carry harder.</p>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="pros time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Better for solo play</li>
						<li>Makes more of a visible impact with more damage</li>
						<li>Damage falls off mid and late game, but you have more points into Time Warp by that point</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="pros time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Better for coordinated play</li>
						<li>Enables other players to carry harder with buffs</li>
						<li>Requires others to follow up to your slows and plays</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>WINNER: This one depends on your group <img src="/img/skills/QE64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>This one comes down to if you want to do your own thing or if you want to empower other players. Very few supports have that versatility through skill diversity.</p>
				<p>If you have an incredible Marksman you're laning with, you can max Time Warp and make their life much easier.</p>
				<p>If you aren't sure of the aptitude of your laner, you can max Time Bomb and poke down champions, or even get kills on your own. It's much more of a cue to the Marksman if the enemy is near dead to finish the job.</p>

			<h3>The Big Downsides to Each Build</h3>
			<div class="pros-and-cons">
				<div class="cons time-bomb">
					<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Dependent on landing Double Bombs, which can be difficult against mobile champions</li>
						<li>Can deny CS/Kills from ADC because of Time Bomb damage</li>
						<li>Tempts you to build AP to do more damage to keep up with the damage pacing of the game, which lowers overall utility</li>
						<li>Much harder to impact the game if you fall behind</li>
						<li>Power slump from level 11 to 15 (before you get 3 points into Time Warp)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="cons time-warp">
					<img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon">
					<ul>
						<li>Requires teammates to be aware of your limitations and coordinate efforts</li>
						<li>Low damage output by yourself, so you rely on your Marksman for damage</li>
						<li>Dependent on allies following up on your CC</li>
						<li>Forces you to play passively and not spam spells (which can be boring to some)</li>
						<li>Arguably higher skill cap to capitalize on enemy mispositions</li>
						<li>Power trough from level 1-4, but then superior utility through the mid-game</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="debate-winner">
				<h5>LOSER: Time Bomb<img src="/img/skills/Q64.png" alt="Time Bomb Skill Icon"></h5>
				<p>I can’t emphasize how difficult it is to land a Double Bomb combo without a good slow.</p>
				<p>In lane, the enemy can use your Time Bombs against you to deny CS from your ADC.</p>
				<p>Maxing Time Warp is very safe and has great potential to make plays, while maxing Time Bomb is riskier.</p>

			<h3>Overall Winner: Time Warp <img src="/img/skills/E64.png" alt="Time Warp Skill Icon"></h3>
			<div class="summary">
				<p>While maxing Time Bomb feel good to do damage, it feels even better when you can get an enemy to Flash at level 5 by walking up to them and pressing Time Warp.</p>
				<p>It feels even better 30 seconds later when you can chase down that same enemy and get an easy kill without taking too much damage.</p>
				<p>Overall, I've had the most success maxing Time Warp because it is a highly versatile tool that really catches enemies off-guard (since there is no cast delay for the spell). I've been playing with a group of 3 to 5 people each game, which means that the group synergy is much higher than a typical solo game.</p>
				<p>Maxing Time Warp goes with the mantra "I'm going to out-smart the enemy by forcing them to waste high cooldown spells trying make something happen".</p>
				<p>When you're starting out, you will want to max Time Bomb first and then try maxing Time Warp once you understand the limitations of Zilean. This gives you a great feel on how different the two builds feel and with experience, you'll find the best skill to max in each situation.</p>
