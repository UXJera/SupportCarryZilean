			<h3>Patch 6.9 (May 4- ???)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-69-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a major patch update that focuses on empowering many of the mid lane mages. Many of the champions have an overlap between mid and support, so things are going to be crazy this patch (as far as supports go). There are many things that I am speculating on, and I will likely revisit this page and the champion matchup page to give a better idea. Best of luck out there!</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="">Zyra Rework</p>
					<p>For starters, the big change to Zyra is that she passively spawns seeds (rather than having to place them down). Additionally, plants of the same type deal 50% less damage to the same target, meaning that she wants to not cast her spells on a pile of seeds, but to drop seeds and spells simultaniously. The plants do a tiny bit less damage than previously.</p>
					<p>Outside of that, her Q was changed from a circular spell radius to a wall-type skillshot (like Malzahar's Q). The rest of her kit is similar to her old kit.</p>
					<p>So the big difference in playstyle is that you have to be mindful of where the seeds are, and be ready to step on them if you have the positioning to do so. She gets more plants, but will be doing overall less damage per plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/brand.png" alt="Brand Icon">
					<p class="">Brand Rework</p>
					<p>Brand's passive was the core change to his kit. Instead of doing the massive damage over time for landing a spell, there is a 3-stack passive on the target that detonates everything around the person affected. The passive does less damage per tick, and rewards players for getting off a full spell rotation (E-> Q stun -> W).</p>
					<p>Going through skill changes, the stun on Brand's Q was dropped from 2 seconds to 1.5 (this is huge). His ultimate now targets those who are Blazed (heh) and tries to detonate as many as possible.</p>
					<p>From my experience, this is a nerf to Brand in the bottom lane. He is much weaker in lane, and has far less of an impact in teamfights, due to his limited economy. If Brand can get ahead in the bottom lane, he will be in a much better position for teamfights.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz "Rework"</p>
					<p>This isn't as much of a rework, and is more of a number switcheroo. Many of AP rations were adjusted (downward), but his passive gained an AP ratio. This means that landing a 3-stack combo is going to be an essential of the kit (I think there is a trend developing here).</p>
					<p>In bottom lane, Vel'Koz poke will hurt less. A lot less, as long as you can dodge skillshots.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/annie.png" alt="Annie Icon">
					<p class="">Annie Update</p>
					<p>The Annie changes look quite scary. Her W (cone spell) has increased range, and her shield now gives significant flat % damage reduction for 2.5 seconds.</p>
					<p>The big change is to Tibbers. Tibbers does slightly less impact damage, and has lower AP ratios. In exchange, Tibbers can regain health, gain extra movement speed running towards Annie, an Enrage effect that gives Tibbers an insane amount of Attack Speed (275% bonus AS) that decays over 3 seconds, the Enrage retriggers if her passive is triggered, AND chases down the killer of Annie.</p>
					<p>I fully expect Annie to make a huge comeback in the bottom lane. The key to success is to focus down the Tibbers ASAP, or run away if you don't die to a burst combo (Annie has one of the strongest level 6 All-Ins for a support).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/syndra.png" alt="Syndra Icon">
					<p class="">Syndra Update</p>
					<p>Syndra is one of those special bottom lane mages that I just love playing. She's incredibly strong, can do level 1 jungle shenanigans, has a powerful ranged stun, and does a surprising amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The big changes to Syndra is that she has can get more orbs out (with max Q), and can grab up to 3 orbs (max W). But the power in support Syndra is the max E. By having more orbs out (possibly 7 or 8 now), you do absurd amounts of damage with your ultimate. As a support, I've been able to 100 to 0 an AD carry at level 9 with minimal AP items (pre change).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerfs</p>
					<p>Soraka has been a major pain, and now has some minor nerfs to her Q (Starcall). The % slow was nerfed to a flat 30% and only grants 10% movement speed.</p>
					<p>Once again, this is a small change that lessens the offensive power of a mostly defensive champion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="buff">Taric Nerfs</p>
					<p>Taric receivced some nerfs to the range and width of his spells, making it tougher to land spells and chain abilities.</p>
					<p>An average Taric isn't scary, but a good Taric is a nightmare to play against. These nerfs should separate the boys from the men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/tear64.png" alt="Tear of the Goddess Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tear of the Goddess Change</p>
					<p>The free bonus 25% mana regen is lowered to 0, but you regain 15% of your mana spent.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is a loss of about 1.7 mana per 5 and a gain a minimum of 23 mana returned per Q W Q combo, which is around a minute of mana regen from the bonus 25% mana regen alone. This makes a 1st buy Tear of the Goddess even more efficient in lane.</p>
					<p>The upgrade into Archangel's Staff returns 25% mana (up from 15% of Tear), which is huge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/chalice64.png" alt="Chalice Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Chalice of "Harmony" Change</p>
					<p>This might be an alternative to Tear (only 150 gold more), but you don't get the extra mana from Tear. The change also makes it versatile to aid sustain, so potions will not be as necessary if you pick this item up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Athene's Unholy Grail Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed and is no longer worthwhile on Zilean at all. The price of the item was significantly lowered, and is only useful for the hybrid regeneration and the 20% CDR. The other passive benefits healers and shielders, so you will NOT want to be going with this item going forward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morellonomicon Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Morellonomicon Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed to be 500 gold more expensive, more AP, no mana regen, proc Grievous Wounds at 35% (from 40%), but kills and assists restore 20% mana (similar to old Athene's). This item is the replacement for Athene's Unholy Grail, but still doesn't feel like the right fit for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class="">Abyssal Scepter Change</p>
					<p>Abyssal was changed to add 10% CDR and a scaling magic resist aura (along with a bump in MR). If you do want to add this item in your build, you need to account for the extra 10% CDR and drop it from somewhere else.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/zhonyas64.png" alt="Zhonya's Hourglass Icon">
					<p class="">Zhonya's Hourglass Change</p>
					<p>Zhonya's took a 600 gold price cut, and has an added 10% CDR. Some other stats were changed, but for Zilean, the CDR and price are the most important things to note. Once again, if you do want to go this item, be mindful of how much CDR you have in your build.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/pink64.png" alt="Vision Ward Icon">
					<p class="">Vision Ward Change</p>
					<p>Pink Wards now have 4 HP, but regain health when out of combat. This means that protecting wards is going to be more valuable, and you can expect more fights to break out around the ward. If you have the opportunity to save the ward, you should try to shove off the enemy, but do not risk your life for the value of a 75g ward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/frostfang64.png" alt="Frostfang Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Frostfang Nerf</p>
					<p>Frostfang is taking a small 25% mana regen nerf, but I do not believe the Eye of the Watchers took a mana regen nerf. Ideally, this is a very small nerf (since you don't stay on Frostfang for long) that will negatively impact enemy laners more than Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/coldgun64.png" alt="GLP 800 Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech GLP 800</p>
					<p>This is an interesting item that I am going to tinker with. It builds out of Catalyst (which was altered to be more consistent with sustain) and a Gunblade. The active is a conal 65% slow, which should serve as a way to get closer to land bombs and slows. The price of the item is 3000g, which is very expensive for a budget support.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/hextechbelt64.png" alt="Protobelt Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech Protobelt-01</p>
					<p>If you've ever played or watched DOTA 2, this item is a weaker version of Blink Dagger. This item is better suited for champions without a dash who want to engage, but also has defensive purposes. I wouldn't recommend getting this item on Zilean because his kit already has enough mobility in it (plus the Protobelt cannot jump over walls).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>General Macro Changes</p>
					<p>There are many more macro oriented changes that were added in this patch, including the Turret and Dragon reworks, but those have much larger implications on the game that go beyond the specialty of Support Zilean.</p>
					<p>Also, be prepared for some overpowered champions to appear in this patch, and watch them slowly get scaled back over the next 3 months.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.8 (Apr 20 - May 4)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-68-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a minor balance patch with the reworked Taric included. And also, new Groovy Zilean artwork.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Taric Rework</p>
					<p>I fully expect Taric to be heavily banned for the first few weeks of patch 6.8, so play testing will be somewhat limited.</p>
					<p>Looking at his skills, there isn't too much to be afraid of, except his stun. Zilean shouldn't have much of a problem because of his speed increase and walking perpendicularly to the skillshot (otherwords, strafe 90 degrees in a direction that Taric is walking).</p>
					<p>His ultimate is more of a team awareness type of skill, but he can time his ultimate to stop a single Time Bomb of damage. All in all, Zilean has enough tools to contain the power of Taric.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Nerfs - Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) Lower Damage</p>
						<p>This nerf tones down the on-hit damage from Kog'Maw's W, making his early game even harder. His Caustic Spittle (Q) was given more Armor/MR shred at early levels, but Kog'Maw shouldn't be looking for early trades unless he has a sustain support.</p>
						<p>At most, this nerf causes Kog'Maw to lose a maximum of 50 DPS at 5.0 attack speed and max W ranks, which isn't too terrible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="buff">Miss Fortune Buff - Strut (W) Shorter CD</p>
						<p>This is a fun little change that increases the overall uptime of Strut (attack speed buff). In order to get the most of it, you have to auto-attack several different targets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/iceborn64.png" alt="Iceborn Gauntlet Icon">
					<p class="buff">Iceborn Gauntlet Nerf - Lower Proc Damage</p>
						<p>This item is a staple for the Blue Ezreal build, which is one of the hardest marksman to pair with and against Support Zilean.</p>
						<p>While the slow, CDR, mana, and armor are still a part of the item, this may disuade players from selecting Ezreal.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.7 (Apr 6 - Apr 20)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-67-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a nerf patch to some of the most popular picks.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/aurelion.png" alt="Aurelion Sol Icon">
					<p class="buff">Aurelion Sol Nerfs - Crowd Control</p>
					<p>Aurelion Sol was a bit obnoxious with the large crowd control he could put out.</p>
					<p>In this patch, his stun duration was cut down to a max of 1.5 seconds (with the same stun scaling as Zilean's Time Bomb); a nerf well deserved.</p>
					<p>Aurelion's ultimate took a big hit in the slow, which means escaping his orbs will be easier.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Jhin Nerfs - Dancing Grenade (Q)</p>
						<p>This nerf added a higher mana cost and lower damage on his Dancing Grenade, a common tool used for last hitting.</p>
						<p>This isn't a devestating nerf, but it will take away from some of the lane dominance that Jhin has when he gets ahead.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kindred Nerfs - Ultimate is now Self-cast</p>
						<p>Although Kindred is uncommonly seen in the bottom lane, the change of her ultimate makes her positioning more critical to the success of the ability. Zilean and Kindred is a solid lane (even better when maxing Time Warp).</p>
						<p>The plus side of this is that Kindred should never miss an ult on herself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/poppy.png" alt="Poppy Icon">
					<p class="buff">Poppy Nerfs - Nerfs around the board</p>
						<p>It's no secret; Poppy was one of the strongest chapmions in the game for quite some time with the versatility to slot into 3 different positons.</p>
						<p>In short, Poppy got nerfs on her passive (shorter range), Hammer Shock - Q (lower base damage), and Heroic Charge - E (shorter charge range). The big one is the nerf on her charge range, meaning she doesn't knock back as far and has to be closer to use the skill.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerf - Mana Costs</p>
						<p>Soraka is still one of the most frustrating supports to lane against, because she effectively nullifies all poke and trade damage, while being able to put out a respectable amount herself.</p>
						<p>These nerfs are targeted for the laning phase so that her healing and damage output will be less than before. Personally, I don't think the nerfs go far enough to solve the Solo Q Soraka problem.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="neutral">Death Timers</p>
						<p>This change lowers the death timers from the 30-55 minute mark for all players.</p>
						<p>This is a neutral change, and could possibly be an indirect nerf to Zilean. Zilean has the ability to prevent a death, and possibly turn a fight around because of the wasted resources going for the kill.</p>
						<p>If you win the fight because of a revive and kill a few members of the enemy team, the amount of objectives that you can take is slightly lower.</p>
						<p>On the plus side, even if you die (as Zilean), you'll be able to get back into the game faster with lower death times. This is one of those situations where if you are playing Zilean perfectly, the lower death timers is a nerf against your team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.6 (Mar 23 - Apr 6)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-66-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch has a nice balance of nerfs to stronger/popular picks and buffs to lesser picked champs. For Support Zilean, there are several "sustain" supports that took a hit, but mostly junglers.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Triumphant Roar (E) Reduction</p>
					<p>This was a subtle nerf to Alistar's sustain, lowering the healing to allies from 50% to 33%, which is a huge hit, considering that recently a longer cooldown was applied to his heal.</p>
					<p>Support Zilean doesn't typically have any problems with Alistar, and this will just push him to be more aggressive, rather than a passive healbot.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/janna.png" alt="Janna Icon">
					<p class="buff">Janna Nerfs - Shield and Ultimate</p>
						<p>The first nerf is a reduction on the flat AD bonus that she gives on her shield. Against Support Zilean, she is likely to use the shields to negate damage from Time Bomb, so it doesn't change the matchup much.</p>
						<p>The second nerf is to her ultimate where the "disable duration" from when you are knocked away is reduced to half of a second. This is a small nerf, but it means she won't be able to pin someone against a wall for as long.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kalista.png" alt="Kalista Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kalista Nerfs - Lower Attack Speed</p>
						<p>Kalista is losing several sources of attack speed, but is having them added to her Sentinal/Ghost. This means that optimally, Kalista has to deploy the ghost in combat in order to get the most of the skill.</p>
						<p>Another thing is that the cast range of her ultimate is reduced close to a max range of champion vision (1100 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Karma Buff - Bigger Empowered Shields</p>
						<p>Karma is getting a sizable buff to her AoE shield (R + E) for the team, with increased ratios and base shielding. This change is directed at mid to late game (she still maxes Q in lane, then shield), so she will be a bit more annoying.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lulu Nerf - Shorter Speed Buffs</p>
						<p>Lulu's Whimsy on friendly targets (the massive movement speed increase) now has a maximum of 4 seconds at max ranks and a lower % movement speed based on AP.</p>
						<p>This means that Lulu mids won't be zipping around the map as often or as quickly.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Patch 6.5 (Mar 9 - Mar 23)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.5 is a smaller patch that doesn't have too much of an impact for Support Zilean, except for the two champions below.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Change - Attack Speed Nerf</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw got his attack speed per level buffed, but removed the passive bonus from his W to compensate. This means that instead of having a massive amount of attack speed at 9 (when W was maxed), you have to continue leveling up to reach the point where it was before.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Soraka Change - Damage and Healing</p>
						<p>These changes have been in the works for some time now, and laning against Soraka before was frustrating. Now, her base heal is weaker and she is more reliant on landing her Starcall (Q) for self-sustain.</p>
						<p>With that being said, if Soraka lands her Starcall, her W heal will be even more powerful than previous patches. This means Soraka players should play more aggressively, instead of being a healbot. Soraka will likely win the trades, as the healing from her Q is really good.</p>
						<p>Personally, I like these changes and make her more dynamic to play with and against. But she is much harder to lane against now.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">PBE Updates</a></p-->
			<h3>Patch 6.4 (Feb 25 - Mar 9)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is a standard balance patch to tone down some of the strong abilities from former patches. This patch doesn't have much affecting Support Zilean.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Ashe Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ashe buff - Q - Ranger's Focus duration</p>
					<p>Ashe got a minor buff to her Q (Ranger's Focus) for a longer duration. While Ashe still isn't popular, Zilean's speed buff does help Ashe take advantage of this buff.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/caitlyn.png" alt="Caitlyn Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Caitlyn buff - Yordle Snap Trap damage</p>
						<p>Caitlyn's trap is now going to be the go-to second skill maxed (or sometimes even being maxed first) and it packs a wallop. The damage was changed around from a flat % of damage to a base value + AD ratio, making her hit even harder with lower AD.</p>
						<p>This makes it crucial that your laner has the ability to push out enough so that you don't get zoned behind a line of traps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ezreal.png" alt="Ezreal Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ezreal nerf - Trueshot Barrage cooldown</p>
					<p>This patch added an additional 50% extra cooldown on Ezreal's Ultimate, but still doesn't offer much in lowering the oppression that Ezreal has with the Iceborn Gauntlet build.</p>
					<p>Zilean is a horrible matchup with and against, so this nerf hopefully makes him less popular.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="buff">Jhin buffs - Minor laning phase buffs</p>
					<p>Pairing Zilean with Jhin is one of the strongest combos that for Jhin. The buffs on this patch are minor and are more quality of life fixes rather than deliberate buffs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw nerf - Base attack speed</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw took a flat attack speed nerf, meaning that his early lane is even harder to farm up (and less overall attack speed throughout the game).</p>
					<p>Since pairing Zilean with and against Kog'Maw is favorable, this nerf is somewhat considerable, but Kog'Maw will still have the same build and playstyle, just with a slightly lower damage output.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian nerf - Culling range decrease</p>
					<p>Lucian is another rough matchup for Zilean, and any nerfs could impact his popularity. This is a pretty substantial decrease to his ultimate range, meaning that it's easier to escape (or puts him more at risk to chase further). It is still hard to Double Bomb him out of the Culling without getting ripped apart (900 range vs. 1200 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tahm Kench nerf - Tongue Lash width decrease</p>
					<p>Tahm Kench has started to fall away from popularity, but is still strong. The difference now is that his Tongue Lash is harder to land (it's 10 units larger than a Mundo Cleaver).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="buff">Boots of Swiftness nerf - 5 Less Base Movespeed </p>
					<p>Boots of Swiftness are losing 5 base movement speed, bringing them to only 15 Movement Speed above the other boots.</p>
					<p>This is a considerable nerf, as Riot is trying to make Boots of Mobility a more appealing option for roamers, rather than having Swifties be the superior option in almost every circumstance.</p>
					<p>What does this mean for Zilean? Fewer Swifties, more potent slows. This is great because Swifties made Zilean's slows less effective, which increases the value of Zilean's kit.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mercs64.png" alt="Mercury Treads Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Mercury's Treads buff - 30% Tencacity</p>
					<p>These boots became unpopular in Season 6 because of the reduced tenacity (from 35% to 20%), but now they are being increased back up to 30.</p>
					<p>On paper, this means that champions with Merc Treads will have lower duration slows and stuns, so this will impact Zilean negatively, but likely be helpful for your own team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.3 (Feb 10 - Feb 25)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-63-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is one of the larger balance patchs as of late. There are many popular champions and items that are being toned down, and a few that are being buffed. Oh, and Duskblade.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/duskblade64.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Duskblade of Draktharr - Assassin Item</p>
					<p> This was the new assassin item introduced in patch 6.3, but it doesn't seem to be as overpowered as many believed it would be, thus it is not a super popular item.</p>
					<p>So Zilean has a leg up on most assassins normally because their burst is usually predictable and its just a matter of finding out when they are committing and hitting your ult.</p>
					<p>This makes Zilean's ult even easier to land in game because of the predictable burst is on a 2 second window (and the assassin leaving after it knows the execute is enough to finish the kill).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar nerf - Increased cooldown on Heal</p><p>Even though Zilean into Alistar is an easy matchup, taking the wind out of Alistar's healing (and the buff provided Windspeaker's Blessing).</p>
					<p>In general, Alistar is still strong, but his lane sustain was reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="buff">Corki nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>Toning down the damage on Corki's Phosphorus Bomb (Q) and increasing the Missile Barrage (R) cooldown, this should make Corki a much less popular pick, but this is mostly directed to get him away from the mid lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/gragas.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p  class="buff">Gragas buffs - W Buff (AoE damage)</p><p>Gragas support is one of my favorite hidden gem supports, and now he's getting a buff (although I do not believe it was warranted). He was already pretty strong in the bottom lane as a Tank/CC support, but Zilean shouldn't have too many problems dealing with him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/graves.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p class="buff">Graves nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>The nerf to the base damage of Grave's End of the Line (Q) is a much needed. Graves was strong in 3 positions (Top/Jungle/ADC), but hopefully this brings him back to only the bottom lane where he is easier to contain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="buff">Kog'Maw buffs - Attack speed change</p><p>By shifting the attack speed bonus from his Q to his W, maxing W on Kog'Maw becomes much more intuitive (rather than an attack speed vs. range tradeoff). Zilean can greatly help out Kog'Maw in lane, or make his life miserable if playing against.</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<p><span class="nerf">Tier 2 Boots changes - Price Up</p><p>These three sets of boots are being bumped up from 800g to 900g, which is a slight nerf, but nothing too impactful. This may actually be a blessing since the difference between Boots of Swiftness and other Teir 2 boots are only 200g. This may mean fewer Swifties in game, which is one item that puts a dent in how effective Zilean's slows can be.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.2 (Jan 28- Feb 10)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-62-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch did some balancing on a few champions, along with the nerf to the popular Frost Queen's Claim. All in all, this was not a major patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Thunderlord's Decree nerf - Variable cooldown</p><p>This is yet another change to Thunderlord's, which makes the talent even less useful for Support Zilean. Right now, there are very few worthwhile final mastery talents to take as Support Zilean. Here's my <a href="/beginner-guides/mastery-breakdown/"> breakdown of the masteries.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spookies64.png" alt="Spooky Ghost Icon">
					<p class="buff">Frost Queen's Claim nerf - Longer cooldown, less slow</p><p>Since this should not be the item you go for, the increase in activation makes this much less appealing for non-supports, which means fewer Spookies in the game overall.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Tahm Kench nerf</p><p>Tahm Kench took a big hit this patch to his damage and passive, but this may mean that he's going to be more prevalent in the bottom lane, in which case he will STILL be annoying at stopping all-ins.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nunu.png" alt="Nunu Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Nunu changes - Snowball Buff</p><p>Nunu got a significant reduction in his snowball, but also lowered the damage. In the bottom lane, I expect him to see some play while players experiment with him, but I doubt he will be strong considering his base damage was lowered and his ratios reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/shen.png" alt="Shen Icon">
					<p class="buff">Shen rework - Less Sustain</p><p>Shen was "reworked" this patch, and his abilities revolve around the positioning of his sword. Shen lost his ability to sustain his lane, but his taunt is unchanged, and he got a new dodge mechanic targeted around his sword that only dodges auto attacks. Shen in the bottom lane is weak, incredibly predictable and exploitable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Grail Icon"><img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p class="buff">Athene's Unholy Grail and Morellonomicon - Price Drop</p><p>Both of these items got a reduction in gold, making them more cost efficient and better buys if you decide to go more AP focused.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-61-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span>This was a minor patch, but did have one major benefit for Zilean, Eye of the Oasis.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p class="buff">Thunderlord's Decree buff</p><p>The AD ratio on Thunderlord's was upped to 30% from 20%, making this a very viable choice for AD burst champions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/eye64.png" alt="Eye of the Oasis Icon"><img src="/img/items/watchers64.png" alt="Eye of the Watchers Icon"></div>
					<p class="buff">Eye of the Oasis/Watchers buff</p><p>This is a huge change for Support Zilean because it means you can get 40% CDR from 4 items, leaving an open spot for pinks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Boots of Swiftness buff</p><p>This was a change that happened early in the preseason, but pro players picked it up quickly and it became the norm. These boots reduce the effectiveness of your Slow, and many champions are taking these boots over other types.</p>
