			<h3>Patch 6.14 (Jul 12 - ???)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-614-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.14 is a patch that includes the Ryze "rework" along with some changes to a handfull of support champions. All in all, this isn't that significant of a patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/leona.png" alt="Leona Icon">
					<p class="">Leona Changes - Lower CDs, lower damage</p>
					<p>Leona has always been a tough early game match up for Zilean, but this may make it a little easier. Starting off, Leona's passive, Q, W, and R do less damage individually.</p>
					<p>Shield of Daybreak (the stun) has a lower cooldown and longer range. The stun duration was also hotfixed to 1 second (instead of 1.25). Zenith Blade (the dash) now has a longer root (.25 to .5), so Leona still has the same amount of CC duration with a combo.</p>
					<p>Eclipse (W) now does 10 damage less per rank. Solar Flare (R) now empowers the Leona's next 3 auto attacks, which have increased range, deal extra damage, and apply the Leona passive. This means that the burst from her ultimate is going to be pretty nasty on a single target.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/sona.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Sona Changes - Auras and Spamming</p>
					<p>Starting off, Sona has a passive on her Ultimate that reduces the cooldown of her basic spells. Keep in mind that the mana cost of Sona's spells are incredibly expensive and spamming isn't an option unless you build for it accordingly.</p>
					<p>Hymn of Valor (Q) does less damage, and rightfully so since it will have a massive amount of cooldown with ultimate ranks.</p>
					<p>Aria of Preserverance (W) now heals more and has a higher ratio, which may entice players into maxing W first on Sona. Also, the empowered W auto attack does even more damage reduction from the enemy struck.</p>
					<p>Song of Celerity (E) has an even higher movement speed increase, and a longer duration out of combat, which means that her roaming ability is increased.</p>
				</li>

			<h3>Patch 6.13 (Jun 29 - Jul 12)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-613-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.13 is a balance patch that looks to alter several of the supports (and starting support items).</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/blitzcrank.png" alt="Blitzcrank Icon">
					<p class="">Blitzcrank Changes - Hook, Knock Up, and Ultimate</p>
					<p>The first change to Blitz is that his pull doesn't pull you as far back, and moves you 75 units in front of Blitz, but this still means he is in auto attack range, but no longer can pull you onto traps.</p>
					<p>The second change is that his Power Fist (E) knockup has a 5 second duration of charge (down from 10) and the auto cannot be cancelled. I've played a fair bit of Blitz in the past, and this should mean that when he hooks you, he will be able to land the knock up punch easier.</p>
					<p>The final change is to his ultimate passive, which randomly damages enemies every so often. This would reveal Blitz in the bush and cancel the movespeed from Boots of Mobility. So now, the passive only procs when Blitzcrank is in combat. So he can now hide in the bush at level 6 and that is something you have to be extra mindful of.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Lulu Buffs - Glitterlance Damage, Whimsy Buff</p>
					<p>Lulu isn't a common pick, and this is a pretty harsh nerf to her early lane harassment. The Glitterlance (Q) only deals 70% damage after its first target, but it has a 2 second decaying slow.</p>
					<p>The next part of her kit that was changed is that her Whimsy (W) now grants bonus attack speed to champions, similar to Nunu's Blood Boil.</p>
					<p>Overall, this reduces her poke and carry potential, and should be easier to deal with in lane as a Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Tahm Kench Buffs - Overall Kit Buffs</p>
					<p>Putting aside my hate of Tahm for a moment, these buffs were made to reduce the clunkiness of his kit.</p>
					<p>The first is that the passive from his ultimate (% based HP added to autos as magic damage) was transfered to his natural passive at level 1. The damage is increased per stack of the fish debuff that gets on you, and does more damage overall.</p>
					<p>The damage from his Tongue Last (Q) was increased by 5 per rank, which doesn't change too much. The shield from his Thick Skin (E) was changed a bit, so now the grey health shield is much weaker until points are invested into it. Also, the shield lasts 3 seconds (down from 6) so he is burstable.</p>
					<p>The final change was to Tahm's Ultimate, where it moves much quicker and is harder to walk away from. Before, you could see the Tahm ultimate on the ground, and simply walk away. Now there is a half second reduction before the ultimate is noticable by the enemy team, so your team has to be much more alert for that ultimate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/thresh.png" alt="Thresh Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Thresh Changes - Dark Passage Ratio Change</p>
					<p>This is a slight change to Thresh, where souls now increase the sheild strength ratio of Thresh. This will increase the overall strength of the sheild granted from the lantern, but not by a large amount. I would like to say that in a given game, you can expect between 50-80 souls to be collected.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="buff">Zyra Nerfs - Plants and Spawning</p>
					<p>This nerf for Zyra was aimed to decrease the number of plants that Zyra could get out over time, her passive and Rampant Growth (W) now have increased cooldowns so fewer seeds should spawn.</p>
					<p>The second change is a bug fix where plants that were spawned with Deadly Spines (Q) would start attacking the closest champion, even if Zyra did not damage them. This takes some of the poke potential away from Zyra during lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zilean.png" alt="Zilean Icon">
					<p class="buff">Zilean Bug fix - Chronoshift and On-Heal Effects</p>
					<p>Whenever I see a Zilean change in the patch notes, I prepare myself for the worst. However, this is a minor change that doesn't effect the Zilean playstyle much (or at least the item builds that I advocate).</p>
					<p>The change was simple, Chronoshift now applies the effects of Athene's Unholy Grail, Ardent Censer, and other healing bonus steps. I do not expect this to revolutionize how Zilean is played, as those items are far too situational for Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ancient_coin64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ancient Coin - 5% CDR</p>
					<p>This is a modest change to this item, and is currently the only item in the game that gives 5% CDR. Even with the 5% CDR onto the item, I still believe that Spellthief's is the best option unless you are going against a lane with heavy poke and you are anticipating the need for additional sustain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/nomad64.png" alt="Nomad's Medallion Icon">
					<p class="buff">Nomad's Medallion - 10% CDR and More Mana Regen</p>
					<p>Nomad's now has 10% CDR built into it, and has more mana regen with fewer health regen. The mana regen is now equal to Frostfang, which means that if you are against a heavy poke lane or you do not think you'll be able to harass the enemy much, then this is a reasonable item to purchase.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/talisman64.png" alt="Talisman of Ascention Icon">
					<p class="buff">Talisman of Ascention - Armor + Situational MS</p>
					<p>The change to Talisman now changes the build path to a Raptor's Cloak, which gives extra movement speed around turrets. With that change, you also get a hefty 45 extra armor added to this item. The cost of the item was increased to 2500, which puts it 300g over the other completed support items. This makes it much less reasonable to buy early on, and you may consider holding off on upgrading this until you're doing much more grouping or roaming around the map.</p>
					<p>I still believe that the Nomad's + Sightstone upgrade is the better choice to make based on item slot efficiency.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Spellthief's Edge Icon">
					<p class="buff">Spellthief's Edge line - Tribute Enhancements</p>
					<p>This change to the Spellthief item line now makes it so that if you kill a pet (Zyra plants), your tribute will not lock itself out. This is a nice quality of life change that doesn't punish us for clearing away Zyra plants.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Spellthief's Edge Icon">
					<p class="buff">Spellthief's Edge line - Tribute Enhancements</p>
					<p>This change to the Spellthief item line now makes it so that if you kill a pet (Zyra plants), your tribute will not lock itself out. This is a nice quality of life change that doesn't punish us for clearing away Zyra plants.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/idol64.png" alt="Forbidden Idol Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Forbidden Idol - Price Hike and Healing</p>
					<p>Forbidden Idol is being shifted towards healing centric items, and has a price increase up to 850g. This item isn't as cost efficient if you are planning to build Mikael's Crucible, so you will have to choose the value of 10% CDR or the health/mana regen from Chalice of Harmony.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mikaels64.png" alt="Mikael's Crucible Icon">
					<p class="buff">Mikael's Crucible - Price Hike and Extra Healing</p>
					<p>Mikael's now costs an extra 100g to complete, but with the bugfix to Zilean and healing, your ultimate now heals an extra 15% life upon revival.</p>
					<p>So let's take a moment to appreciate this. Zilean's ultimate has a 200% AP ratio, along with a huge life gane on revival. In previous patches, a rank 2 ultimate with 150 AP would revive back at 1150 HP. In the current patch, with those same numbers, the revive would heal back 1322, which is an extra 170 HP just by having this item.</p>
					<p>Now I don't think that every game should be a Mikael's rush, or even a game where you would want to take this item, but this adds a fair chunk of gold value to an item that you may have purchased anyways.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ruby64.png" alt="Ruby Sightstone Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Ruby Sightstone - Price Decrease and more Item CDR</p>
					<p>Ruby Sightstone now only costs 1600g, which is an extra 800 after the item is first bought. Additionally, the Item Cooldown Reduction is now 20%. This is an appetizing buy for Zilean, because you have the potential to have several activatible items in your build: Frost Queen's Claim or Talisman of Ascention, Zeke's Harbinger, Banner of Command or Locket of the Iron Solari, Seraph's Embrace.</p>
					<p>The changes also makes this Sightstone the cheapest to upgrade, which gives you more money for other items. But generally, the Ruby Sightstone is one of the later upgrades in the game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/trinket_ward64.png" alt="Ward Icon">
					<p class="buff">Wards - Ward Kills Give XP</p>
					<p>Wards now grant 30 XP when killed (but it isn't clarified if it is locally shared, or only given to the person who makes the final blow) and attacking a ward will not put into combat if using Boots of Mobility or the Cloud Drake buff.</p>
					<p>The big deal is that you get an extra 30 XP per ward kill, which is about the shared experience for a single minion. While this doesn't seem like much, with Zilean's passive you can quickly gain the XP lead if you are vigilant.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.12 (Jun 14 - Jun 29)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.12 mainly adjusted masteries, AD itemization, and the buffing of a few weaker champions. The one thing to note for this patch is that there are some improvements to some of the masteries in the Resolve (defense) tree that may make it better for most Zilean supports.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<p class="">AD Itemization Changes</p>
					<p>In short, the AD itemization is to move away from Ghostblade and move towards Infinity Edge and Essence Reaver as a first item. The next change is improving the power on Last Whisper items to have higher base AD, making it a priority 4th item (much like it was in season's past).</p>
					<p>The purpose of this is to diversify the AD champion pool, however there are still some champions whose strengths are greater than the itemization improvements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Corki Buff - Gatling Gun buffs</p>
					<p>Riot has been giving Corki some extra love these past few patches, and this one is no different. The big change this patch is that the armor shred last longer and is refreshed if triggered at full stacks. This means that Corki's Gatling Gun will be stronger if he jumps onto you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/res22.png" alt="Veteran Scars Icon">
					<p class="buff">Veteran Scars - +5 HP at max ranks</p>
					<p>Of the mastery changes, this is the only adjustment to make note of. The change adds just a tad bit of HP to lane, which makes it quite valuable (worth 6 yellow HP runes, or 2 HP quints). Granted, this change only reinforces a safer playstyle and does not make one mastery set up superior to the other.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.11 (Jun 2 - Jun 14)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-611-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.11 is mostly a nerf patch to some of the strongest champions in League. Many of the Top Tier Competitive Champs (Azir, Ekko, Kindred, Lucian, Nidalee, Ryze, Swain, Zed) took some big nerfs. But since we're focusing on Support Zilean matchups, many things in this patch don't impact the bottom lane directly.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="">Corki Buff - Ultimate AD Ratios</p>
					<p>This is a subtle bump to Corki's Missile Barrage, making it slightly stronger. At this point, I welcome a wider champion diversity in the bottom lane, instead of Lucian/Caitlyn/Ezreal in every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian Nerf - Q Damage and Range</p>
					<p>Lucian needs nerfs. There are very few who disagree with this. The big difference is that in lane, he will have a harder time aiming his Q to pass through minions and hit those funky angles that cause you or your ADC to take a modest amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The scaling on his Q was also lowered, but he can still pump out tons of damage when he gets enough CDR and mobility. The Ghostblade/Black Cleaver has become the staple build, which gives him plenty of CDR, mobility, and armor shred.</p>
					<p>Maybe I'm just a little frustrated having to play with or against this champ every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz Buff - Longer Q slow, Ultimate can stack passive</p>
					<p>These buffs make Vel'Koz even more playable, but his numbers are still low and dependent on landing a full combo.</p>
					<p>The change to his ultimate makes it forgiving so you can get a stack for every .7 seconds the person is in a beam. The channel duration is 2.5 seconds, so you shouldn't have to worry about the true damage unless you have 1 or 2 stacks on already.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Boots of Swiftness - 5 less Movespeed</p>
					<p>These boots take another nerf, which makes them only have 10 more Movespeed over other Tier 2 boots. The passive is really the only reason to pick up these boots now, and that is still a situational purchase.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is favorable, because the Swifties should be less common, and your slows more potent.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a rather quiet patch. Many of the changes this patch are subtle buffs to the mid lane mages who didn't perform as admirably as Riot had hoped.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Ultimate Dmg Reduction down</p>
					<p>Alistar's Ultimate (at rank 1) now only halves damage for the duration, instead of 70%. Alistar still has incredible tower diving potential, he just has to be extra careful near the end of the duration to not take an extra tower shot when the ultimate fades.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Zyra Nerf - Passive Seed Change</p>
					<p>The passive seeds now have shorter "stomp" immunity period. This is a minor change that doesn't affect play much.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.9 (May 4- May 18)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-69-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a major patch update that focuses on empowering many of the mid lane mages, but reducing their power in the bottom lane.</p>
			<p>This is a significant patch, with changes to both champions and items. Here are my impressions of Patch 6.9 so far.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="">Zyra Rework</p>
					<p>For starters, the big change to Zyra is that she passively spawns seeds (rather than having to place them down). Additionally, plants of the same type deal 50% less damage to the same target, meaning that she wants to not cast her spells on a pile of seeds, but to drop seeds and spells simultaniously. The plants do a tiny bit less damage than previously.</p>
					<p>Outside of that, her Q was changed from a circular spell radius to a wall-type skillshot (like Malzahar's Q). The rest of her kit is similar to her old kit.</p>
					<p>So the big difference in playstyle is that you have to be mindful of where the seeds are, and be ready to step on them if you have the positioning to do so. She gets more plants, but will be doing overall less damage per plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/brand.png" alt="Brand Icon">
					<p class="">Brand Rework</p>
					<p>Brand's passive was the core change to his kit. Instead of doing the massive damage over time for landing a spell, there is a 3-stack passive on the target that detonates everything around the person affected. The passive does less damage per tick, and rewards players for getting off a full spell rotation (E-> Q stun -> W).</p>
					<p>Going through skill changes, the stun on Brand's Q was dropped from 2 seconds to 1.5 (this is huge). His ultimate now targets those who are Blazed (heh) and tries to detonate as many as possible.</p>
					<p>From my experience, this is a nerf to Brand in the bottom lane. He is much weaker in lane, and has far less of an impact in teamfights, due to his limited economy. If Brand can get ahead in the bottom lane, he will be in a much better position for teamfights.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz "Rework"</p>
					<p>This isn't as much of a rework, and is more of a number switcheroo. Many of AP rations were adjusted (downward), but his passive gained an AP ratio. This means that landing a 3-stack combo is going to be an essential of the kit (I think there is a trend developing here).</p>
					<p>In bottom lane, Vel'Koz poke will hurt less. A lot less, as long as you can dodge skillshots.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/annie.png" alt="Annie Icon">
					<p class="">Annie Update</p>
					<p>The Annie changes look quite scary. Her W (cone spell) has increased range, and her shield now gives significant flat % damage reduction for 2.5 seconds.</p>
					<p>The big change is to Tibbers. Tibbers does slightly less impact damage, and has lower AP ratios. In exchange, Tibbers can regain health, gain extra movement speed running towards Annie, an Enrage effect that gives Tibbers an insane amount of Attack Speed (275% bonus AS) that decays over 3 seconds, the Enrage retriggers if her passive is triggered, AND chases down the killer of Annie.</p>
					<p>Simply put, if you are going to stay in lane after the all-in, you must kill the Tibbers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/syndra.png" alt="Syndra Icon">
					<p class="">Syndra Update</p>
					<p>Syndra is one of those special bottom lane mages that I just love playing. She's incredibly strong, can do level 1 jungle shenanigans, has a powerful ranged stun, and does a surprising amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The big changes to Syndra is that she has can get more orbs out (with max Q), and can grab up to 3 orbs (max W). But the power in support Syndra is the max E. By having more orbs out (possibly 7 or 8 now), you do absurd amounts of damage with your ultimate. As a support, I've been able to 100 to 0 an AD carry at level 9 with minimal AP items (pre change).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerfs</p>
					<p>Soraka has been a major pain, and now has some minor nerfs to her Q (Starcall). The % slow was nerfed to a flat 30% and only grants 10% movement speed.</p>
					<p>Once again, this is a small change that lessens the offensive power of a mostly defensive champion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="buff">Taric Nerfs</p>
					<p>Taric receivced some nerfs to the range and width of his spells, making it tougher to land spells and chain abilities.</p>
					<p>An average Taric isn't scary, but a good Taric is a nightmare to play against. These nerfs should separate the boys from the men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/tear64.png" alt="Tear of the Goddess Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tear of the Goddess Change</p>
					<p>The free bonus 25% mana regen is lowered to 0, but you regain 15% of your mana spent.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is a loss of about 1.7 mana per 5 and a gain a minimum of 23 mana returned per Q W Q combo, which is around a minute of mana regen from the bonus 25% mana regen alone. This makes a 1st buy Tear of the Goddess even more efficient in lane.</p>
					<p>The upgrade into Archangel's Staff returns 25% mana (up from 15% of Tear), which is huge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/chalice64.png" alt="Chalice Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Chalice of "Harmony" Change</p>
					<p>This might be an alternative to Tear (only 150 gold more), but you don't get the extra mana from Tear. The change also makes it versatile to aid sustain, so potions will not be as necessary if you pick this item up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Athene's Unholy Grail Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed and is no longer worthwhile on Zilean at all. The price of the item was significantly lowered, and is only useful for the hybrid regeneration and the 20% CDR. The other passive benefits healers and shielders, so you will NOT want to be going with this item going forward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morellonomicon Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Morellonomicon Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed to be 500 gold more expensive, more AP, no mana regen, proc Grievous Wounds at 35% (from 40%), but kills and assists restore 20% mana (similar to old Athene's). This item is the replacement for Athene's Unholy Grail, but still doesn't feel like the right fit for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class="">Abyssal Scepter Change</p>
					<p>Abyssal was changed to add 10% CDR and a scaling magic resist aura (along with a bump in MR). If you do want to add this item in your build, you need to account for the extra 10% CDR and drop it from somewhere else.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/zhonyas64.png" alt="Zhonya's Hourglass Icon">
					<p class="">Zhonya's Hourglass Change</p>
					<p>Zhonya's took a 600 gold price cut, and has an added 10% CDR. Some other stats were changed, but for Zilean, the CDR and price are the most important things to note. Once again, if you do want to go this item, be mindful of how much CDR you have in your build.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/pink64.png" alt="Vision Ward Icon">
					<p class="">Vision Ward Change</p>
					<p>Pink Wards now have 4 HP, but regain health when out of combat. This means that protecting wards is going to be more valuable, and you can expect more fights to break out around the ward. If you have the opportunity to save the ward, you should try to shove off the enemy, but do not risk your life for the value of a 75g ward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/frostfang64.png" alt="Frostfang Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Frostfang Nerf</p>
					<p>Frostfang is taking a small 25% mana regen nerf, but I do not believe the Eye of the Watchers took a mana regen nerf. Ideally, this is a very small nerf (since you don't stay on Frostfang for long) that will negatively impact enemy laners more than Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/coldgun64.png" alt="GLP 800 Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech GLP 800</p>
					<p>This is an interesting item that I am going to tinker with. It builds out of Catalyst (which was altered to be more consistent with sustain) and a Gunblade. The active is a conal 65% slow, which should serve as a way to get closer to land bombs and slows. The price of the item is 3000g, which is very expensive for a budget support.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/hextechbelt64.png" alt="Protobelt Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech Protobelt-01</p>
					<p>If you've ever played or watched DOTA 2, this item is a weaker version of Blink Dagger. This item is better suited for champions without a dash who want to engage, but also has defensive purposes. I wouldn't recommend getting this item on Zilean because his kit already has enough mobility in it (plus the Protobelt cannot jump over walls).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>General Macro Changes</p>
					<p>There are many more macro oriented changes that were added in this patch, including the Turret and Dragon reworks, but those have much larger implications on the game that go beyond the specialty of Support Zilean.</p>
					<p>Also, be prepared for some overpowered champions to appear in this patch, and watch them slowly get scaled back over the next 3 months.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.8 (Apr 20 - May 4)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-68-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a minor balance patch with the reworked Taric included. And also, new Groovy Zilean artwork.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Taric Rework</p>
					<p>I fully expect Taric to be heavily banned for the first few weeks of patch 6.8, so play testing will be somewhat limited.</p>
					<p>Looking at his skills, there isn't too much to be afraid of, except his stun. Zilean shouldn't have much of a problem because of his speed increase and walking perpendicularly to the skillshot (otherwords, strafe 90 degrees in a direction that Taric is walking).</p>
					<p>His ultimate is more of a team awareness type of skill, but he can time his ultimate to stop a single Time Bomb of damage. All in all, Zilean has enough tools to contain the power of Taric.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Nerfs - Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) Lower Damage</p>
						<p>This nerf tones down the on-hit damage from Kog'Maw's W, making his early game even harder. His Caustic Spittle (Q) was given more Armor/MR shred at early levels, but Kog'Maw shouldn't be looking for early trades unless he has a sustain support.</p>
						<p>At most, this nerf causes Kog'Maw to lose a maximum of 50 DPS at 5.0 attack speed and max W ranks, which isn't too terrible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="buff">Miss Fortune Buff - Strut (W) Shorter CD</p>
						<p>This is a fun little change that increases the overall uptime of Strut (attack speed buff). In order to get the most of it, you have to auto-attack several different targets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/iceborn64.png" alt="Iceborn Gauntlet Icon">
					<p class="buff">Iceborn Gauntlet Nerf - Lower Proc Damage</p>
						<p>This item is a staple for the Blue Ezreal build, which is one of the hardest marksman to pair with and against Support Zilean.</p>
						<p>While the slow, CDR, mana, and armor are still a part of the item, this may disuade players from selecting Ezreal.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.7 (Apr 6 - Apr 20)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-67-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a nerf patch to some of the most popular picks.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/aurelion.png" alt="Aurelion Sol Icon">
					<p class="buff">Aurelion Sol Nerfs - Crowd Control</p>
					<p>Aurelion Sol was a bit obnoxious with the large crowd control he could put out.</p>
					<p>In this patch, his stun duration was cut down to a max of 1.5 seconds (with the same stun scaling as Zilean's Time Bomb); a nerf well deserved.</p>
					<p>Aurelion's ultimate took a big hit in the slow, which means escaping his orbs will be easier.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Jhin Nerfs - Dancing Grenade (Q)</p>
						<p>This nerf added a higher mana cost and lower damage on his Dancing Grenade, a common tool used for last hitting.</p>
						<p>This isn't a devestating nerf, but it will take away from some of the lane dominance that Jhin has when he gets ahead.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kindred Nerfs - Ultimate is now Self-cast</p>
						<p>Although Kindred is uncommonly seen in the bottom lane, the change of her ultimate makes her positioning more critical to the success of the ability. Zilean and Kindred is a solid lane (even better when maxing Time Warp).</p>
						<p>The plus side of this is that Kindred should never miss an ult on herself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/poppy.png" alt="Poppy Icon">
					<p class="buff">Poppy Nerfs - Nerfs around the board</p>
						<p>It's no secret; Poppy was one of the strongest chapmions in the game for quite some time with the versatility to slot into 3 different positons.</p>
						<p>In short, Poppy got nerfs on her passive (shorter range), Hammer Shock - Q (lower base damage), and Heroic Charge - E (shorter charge range). The big one is the nerf on her charge range, meaning she doesn't knock back as far and has to be closer to use the skill.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerf - Mana Costs</p>
						<p>Soraka is still one of the most frustrating supports to lane against, because she effectively nullifies all poke and trade damage, while being able to put out a respectable amount herself.</p>
						<p>These nerfs are targeted for the laning phase so that her healing and damage output will be less than before. Personally, I don't think the nerfs go far enough to solve the Solo Q Soraka problem.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="neutral">Death Timers</p>
						<p>This change lowers the death timers from the 30-55 minute mark for all players.</p>
						<p>This is a neutral change, and could possibly be an indirect nerf to Zilean. Zilean has the ability to prevent a death, and possibly turn a fight around because of the wasted resources going for the kill.</p>
						<p>If you win the fight because of a revive and kill a few members of the enemy team, the amount of objectives that you can take is slightly lower.</p>
						<p>On the plus side, even if you die (as Zilean), you'll be able to get back into the game faster with lower death times. This is one of those situations where if you are playing Zilean perfectly, the lower death timers is a nerf against your team.</p>
