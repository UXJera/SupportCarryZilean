			<h3>Patch 6.12 (Jun 14 - ???)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.12 mainly adjusted masteries, AD itemization, and the buffing of a few weaker champions. The one thing to note for this patch is that there are some improvements to some of the masteries in the Resolve (defense) tree that may make it better for most Zilean supports.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<p class="">AD Itemization Changes</p>
					<p>In short, the AD itemization is to move away from Ghostblade and move towards Infinity Edge and Essence Reaver as a first item. The next change is improving the power on Last Whisper items to have higher base AD, making it a priority 4th item (much like it was in season's past).</p>
					<p>The purpose of this is to diversify the AD champion pool, however there are still some champions whose strengths are greater than the itemization improvements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Corki Buff - Gatling Gun buffs</p>
					<p>Riot has been giving Corki some extra love these past few patches, and this one is no different. The big change this patch is that the armor shred last longer and is refreshed if triggered at full stacks. This means that Corki's Gatling Gun will be stronger if he jumps onto you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/res22.png" alt="Veteran Scars Icon">
					<p class="buff">Veteran Scars - +5 HP at max ranks</p>
					<p>Of the mastery changes, this is the only adjustment to make note of. The change adds just a tad bit of HP to lane, which makes it quite valuable (worth 6 yellow HP runes, or 2 HP quints). Granted, this change only reinforces a safer playstyle and does not make one mastery set up superior to the other.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.11 (Jun 2 - Jun 14)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-611-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.11 is mostly a nerf patch to some of the strongest champions in League. Many of the Top Tier Competitive Champs (Azir, Ekko, Kindred, Lucian, Nidalee, Ryze, Swain, Zed) took some big nerfs. But since we're focusing on Support Zilean matchups, many things in this patch don't impact the bottom lane directly.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="">Corki Buff - Ultimate AD Ratios</p>
					<p>This is a subtle bump to Corki's Missile Barrage, making it slightly stronger. At this point, I welcome a wider champion diversity in the bottom lane, instead of Lucian/Caitlyn/Ezreal in every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian Nerf - Q Damage and Range</p>
					<p>Lucian needs nerfs. There are very few who disagree with this. The big difference is that in lane, he will have a harder time aiming his Q to pass through minions and hit those funky angles that cause you or your ADC to take a modest amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The scaling on his Q was also lowered, but he can still pump out tons of damage when he gets enough CDR and mobility. The Ghostblade/Black Cleaver has become the staple build, which gives him plenty of CDR, mobility, and armor shred.</p>
					<p>Maybe I'm just a little frustrated having to play with or against this champ every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz Buff - Longer Q slow, Ultimate can stack passive</p>
					<p>These buffs make Vel'Koz even more playable, but his numbers are still low and dependent on landing a full combo.</p>
					<p>The change to his ultimate makes it forgiving so you can get a stack for every .7 seconds the person is in a beam. The channel duration is 2.5 seconds, so you shouldn't have to worry about the true damage unless you have 1 or 2 stacks on already.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Boots of Swiftness - 5 less Movespeed</p>
					<p>These boots take another nerf, which makes them only have 10 more Movespeed over other Tier 2 boots. The passive is really the only reason to pick up these boots now, and that is still a situational purchase.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is favorable, because the Swifties should be less common, and your slows more potent.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a rather quiet patch. Many of the changes this patch are subtle buffs to the mid lane mages who didn't perform as admirably as Riot had hoped.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Ultimate Dmg Reduction down</p>
					<p>Alistar's Ultimate (at rank 1) now only halves damage for the duration, instead of 70%. Alistar still has incredible tower diving potential, he just has to be extra careful near the end of the duration to not take an extra tower shot when the ultimate fades.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Zyra Nerf - Passive Seed Change</p>
					<p>The passive seeds now have shorter "stomp" immunity period. This is a minor change that doesn't affect play much.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.9 (May 4- May 18)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-69-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a major patch update that focuses on empowering many of the mid lane mages, but reducing their power in the bottom lane.</p>
			<p>This is a significant patch, with changes to both champions and items. Here are my impressions of Patch 6.9 so far.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="">Zyra Rework</p>
					<p>For starters, the big change to Zyra is that she passively spawns seeds (rather than having to place them down). Additionally, plants of the same type deal 50% less damage to the same target, meaning that she wants to not cast her spells on a pile of seeds, but to drop seeds and spells simultaniously. The plants do a tiny bit less damage than previously.</p>
					<p>Outside of that, her Q was changed from a circular spell radius to a wall-type skillshot (like Malzahar's Q). The rest of her kit is similar to her old kit.</p>
					<p>So the big difference in playstyle is that you have to be mindful of where the seeds are, and be ready to step on them if you have the positioning to do so. She gets more plants, but will be doing overall less damage per plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/brand.png" alt="Brand Icon">
					<p class="">Brand Rework</p>
					<p>Brand's passive was the core change to his kit. Instead of doing the massive damage over time for landing a spell, there is a 3-stack passive on the target that detonates everything around the person affected. The passive does less damage per tick, and rewards players for getting off a full spell rotation (E-> Q stun -> W).</p>
					<p>Going through skill changes, the stun on Brand's Q was dropped from 2 seconds to 1.5 (this is huge). His ultimate now targets those who are Blazed (heh) and tries to detonate as many as possible.</p>
					<p>From my experience, this is a nerf to Brand in the bottom lane. He is much weaker in lane, and has far less of an impact in teamfights, due to his limited economy. If Brand can get ahead in the bottom lane, he will be in a much better position for teamfights.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz "Rework"</p>
					<p>This isn't as much of a rework, and is more of a number switcheroo. Many of AP rations were adjusted (downward), but his passive gained an AP ratio. This means that landing a 3-stack combo is going to be an essential of the kit (I think there is a trend developing here).</p>
					<p>In bottom lane, Vel'Koz poke will hurt less. A lot less, as long as you can dodge skillshots.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/annie.png" alt="Annie Icon">
					<p class="">Annie Update</p>
					<p>The Annie changes look quite scary. Her W (cone spell) has increased range, and her shield now gives significant flat % damage reduction for 2.5 seconds.</p>
					<p>The big change is to Tibbers. Tibbers does slightly less impact damage, and has lower AP ratios. In exchange, Tibbers can regain health, gain extra movement speed running towards Annie, an Enrage effect that gives Tibbers an insane amount of Attack Speed (275% bonus AS) that decays over 3 seconds, the Enrage retriggers if her passive is triggered, AND chases down the killer of Annie.</p>
					<p>Simply put, if you are going to stay in lane after the all-in, you must kill the Tibbers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/syndra.png" alt="Syndra Icon">
					<p class="">Syndra Update</p>
					<p>Syndra is one of those special bottom lane mages that I just love playing. She's incredibly strong, can do level 1 jungle shenanigans, has a powerful ranged stun, and does a surprising amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The big changes to Syndra is that she has can get more orbs out (with max Q), and can grab up to 3 orbs (max W). But the power in support Syndra is the max E. By having more orbs out (possibly 7 or 8 now), you do absurd amounts of damage with your ultimate. As a support, I've been able to 100 to 0 an AD carry at level 9 with minimal AP items (pre change).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerfs</p>
					<p>Soraka has been a major pain, and now has some minor nerfs to her Q (Starcall). The % slow was nerfed to a flat 30% and only grants 10% movement speed.</p>
					<p>Once again, this is a small change that lessens the offensive power of a mostly defensive champion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="buff">Taric Nerfs</p>
					<p>Taric receivced some nerfs to the range and width of his spells, making it tougher to land spells and chain abilities.</p>
					<p>An average Taric isn't scary, but a good Taric is a nightmare to play against. These nerfs should separate the boys from the men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/tear64.png" alt="Tear of the Goddess Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tear of the Goddess Change</p>
					<p>The free bonus 25% mana regen is lowered to 0, but you regain 15% of your mana spent.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is a loss of about 1.7 mana per 5 and a gain a minimum of 23 mana returned per Q W Q combo, which is around a minute of mana regen from the bonus 25% mana regen alone. This makes a 1st buy Tear of the Goddess even more efficient in lane.</p>
					<p>The upgrade into Archangel's Staff returns 25% mana (up from 15% of Tear), which is huge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/chalice64.png" alt="Chalice Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Chalice of "Harmony" Change</p>
					<p>This might be an alternative to Tear (only 150 gold more), but you don't get the extra mana from Tear. The change also makes it versatile to aid sustain, so potions will not be as necessary if you pick this item up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Athene's Unholy Grail Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed and is no longer worthwhile on Zilean at all. The price of the item was significantly lowered, and is only useful for the hybrid regeneration and the 20% CDR. The other passive benefits healers and shielders, so you will NOT want to be going with this item going forward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morellonomicon Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Morellonomicon Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed to be 500 gold more expensive, more AP, no mana regen, proc Grievous Wounds at 35% (from 40%), but kills and assists restore 20% mana (similar to old Athene's). This item is the replacement for Athene's Unholy Grail, but still doesn't feel like the right fit for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class="">Abyssal Scepter Change</p>
					<p>Abyssal was changed to add 10% CDR and a scaling magic resist aura (along with a bump in MR). If you do want to add this item in your build, you need to account for the extra 10% CDR and drop it from somewhere else.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/zhonyas64.png" alt="Zhonya's Hourglass Icon">
					<p class="">Zhonya's Hourglass Change</p>
					<p>Zhonya's took a 600 gold price cut, and has an added 10% CDR. Some other stats were changed, but for Zilean, the CDR and price are the most important things to note. Once again, if you do want to go this item, be mindful of how much CDR you have in your build.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/pink64.png" alt="Vision Ward Icon">
					<p class="">Vision Ward Change</p>
					<p>Pink Wards now have 4 HP, but regain health when out of combat. This means that protecting wards is going to be more valuable, and you can expect more fights to break out around the ward. If you have the opportunity to save the ward, you should try to shove off the enemy, but do not risk your life for the value of a 75g ward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/frostfang64.png" alt="Frostfang Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Frostfang Nerf</p>
					<p>Frostfang is taking a small 25% mana regen nerf, but I do not believe the Eye of the Watchers took a mana regen nerf. Ideally, this is a very small nerf (since you don't stay on Frostfang for long) that will negatively impact enemy laners more than Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/coldgun64.png" alt="GLP 800 Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech GLP 800</p>
					<p>This is an interesting item that I am going to tinker with. It builds out of Catalyst (which was altered to be more consistent with sustain) and a Gunblade. The active is a conal 65% slow, which should serve as a way to get closer to land bombs and slows. The price of the item is 3000g, which is very expensive for a budget support.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/hextechbelt64.png" alt="Protobelt Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech Protobelt-01</p>
					<p>If you've ever played or watched DOTA 2, this item is a weaker version of Blink Dagger. This item is better suited for champions without a dash who want to engage, but also has defensive purposes. I wouldn't recommend getting this item on Zilean because his kit already has enough mobility in it (plus the Protobelt cannot jump over walls).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>General Macro Changes</p>
					<p>There are many more macro oriented changes that were added in this patch, including the Turret and Dragon reworks, but those have much larger implications on the game that go beyond the specialty of Support Zilean.</p>
					<p>Also, be prepared for some overpowered champions to appear in this patch, and watch them slowly get scaled back over the next 3 months.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.8 (Apr 20 - May 4)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-68-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a minor balance patch with the reworked Taric included. And also, new Groovy Zilean artwork.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Taric Rework</p>
					<p>I fully expect Taric to be heavily banned for the first few weeks of patch 6.8, so play testing will be somewhat limited.</p>
					<p>Looking at his skills, there isn't too much to be afraid of, except his stun. Zilean shouldn't have much of a problem because of his speed increase and walking perpendicularly to the skillshot (otherwords, strafe 90 degrees in a direction that Taric is walking).</p>
					<p>His ultimate is more of a team awareness type of skill, but he can time his ultimate to stop a single Time Bomb of damage. All in all, Zilean has enough tools to contain the power of Taric.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Nerfs - Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) Lower Damage</p>
						<p>This nerf tones down the on-hit damage from Kog'Maw's W, making his early game even harder. His Caustic Spittle (Q) was given more Armor/MR shred at early levels, but Kog'Maw shouldn't be looking for early trades unless he has a sustain support.</p>
						<p>At most, this nerf causes Kog'Maw to lose a maximum of 50 DPS at 5.0 attack speed and max W ranks, which isn't too terrible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="buff">Miss Fortune Buff - Strut (W) Shorter CD</p>
						<p>This is a fun little change that increases the overall uptime of Strut (attack speed buff). In order to get the most of it, you have to auto-attack several different targets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/iceborn64.png" alt="Iceborn Gauntlet Icon">
					<p class="buff">Iceborn Gauntlet Nerf - Lower Proc Damage</p>
						<p>This item is a staple for the Blue Ezreal build, which is one of the hardest marksman to pair with and against Support Zilean.</p>
						<p>While the slow, CDR, mana, and armor are still a part of the item, this may disuade players from selecting Ezreal.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.7 (Apr 6 - Apr 20)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-67-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a nerf patch to some of the most popular picks.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/aurelion.png" alt="Aurelion Sol Icon">
					<p class="buff">Aurelion Sol Nerfs - Crowd Control</p>
					<p>Aurelion Sol was a bit obnoxious with the large crowd control he could put out.</p>
					<p>In this patch, his stun duration was cut down to a max of 1.5 seconds (with the same stun scaling as Zilean's Time Bomb); a nerf well deserved.</p>
					<p>Aurelion's ultimate took a big hit in the slow, which means escaping his orbs will be easier.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Jhin Nerfs - Dancing Grenade (Q)</p>
						<p>This nerf added a higher mana cost and lower damage on his Dancing Grenade, a common tool used for last hitting.</p>
						<p>This isn't a devestating nerf, but it will take away from some of the lane dominance that Jhin has when he gets ahead.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kindred Nerfs - Ultimate is now Self-cast</p>
						<p>Although Kindred is uncommonly seen in the bottom lane, the change of her ultimate makes her positioning more critical to the success of the ability. Zilean and Kindred is a solid lane (even better when maxing Time Warp).</p>
						<p>The plus side of this is that Kindred should never miss an ult on herself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/poppy.png" alt="Poppy Icon">
					<p class="buff">Poppy Nerfs - Nerfs around the board</p>
						<p>It's no secret; Poppy was one of the strongest chapmions in the game for quite some time with the versatility to slot into 3 different positons.</p>
						<p>In short, Poppy got nerfs on her passive (shorter range), Hammer Shock - Q (lower base damage), and Heroic Charge - E (shorter charge range). The big one is the nerf on her charge range, meaning she doesn't knock back as far and has to be closer to use the skill.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerf - Mana Costs</p>
						<p>Soraka is still one of the most frustrating supports to lane against, because she effectively nullifies all poke and trade damage, while being able to put out a respectable amount herself.</p>
						<p>These nerfs are targeted for the laning phase so that her healing and damage output will be less than before. Personally, I don't think the nerfs go far enough to solve the Solo Q Soraka problem.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="neutral">Death Timers</p>
						<p>This change lowers the death timers from the 30-55 minute mark for all players.</p>
						<p>This is a neutral change, and could possibly be an indirect nerf to Zilean. Zilean has the ability to prevent a death, and possibly turn a fight around because of the wasted resources going for the kill.</p>
						<p>If you win the fight because of a revive and kill a few members of the enemy team, the amount of objectives that you can take is slightly lower.</p>
						<p>On the plus side, even if you die (as Zilean), you'll be able to get back into the game faster with lower death times. This is one of those situations where if you are playing Zilean perfectly, the lower death timers is a nerf against your team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.6 (Mar 23 - Apr 6)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-66-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch has a nice balance of nerfs to stronger/popular picks and buffs to lesser picked champs. For Support Zilean, there are several "sustain" supports that took a hit, but mostly junglers.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Triumphant Roar (E) Reduction</p>
					<p>This was a subtle nerf to Alistar's sustain, lowering the healing to allies from 50% to 33%, which is a huge hit, considering that recently a longer cooldown was applied to his heal.</p>
					<p>Support Zilean doesn't typically have any problems with Alistar, and this will just push him to be more aggressive, rather than a passive healbot.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/janna.png" alt="Janna Icon">
					<p class="buff">Janna Nerfs - Shield and Ultimate</p>
						<p>The first nerf is a reduction on the flat AD bonus that she gives on her shield. Against Support Zilean, she is likely to use the shields to negate damage from Time Bomb, so it doesn't change the matchup much.</p>
						<p>The second nerf is to her ultimate where the "disable duration" from when you are knocked away is reduced to half of a second. This is a small nerf, but it means she won't be able to pin someone against a wall for as long.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kalista.png" alt="Kalista Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kalista Nerfs - Lower Attack Speed</p>
						<p>Kalista is losing several sources of attack speed, but is having them added to her Sentinal/Ghost. This means that optimally, Kalista has to deploy the ghost in combat in order to get the most of the skill.</p>
						<p>Another thing is that the cast range of her ultimate is reduced close to a max range of champion vision (1100 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<p class="nerf">Karma Buff - Bigger Empowered Shields</p>
						<p>Karma is getting a sizable buff to her AoE shield (R + E) for the team, with increased ratios and base shielding. This change is directed at mid to late game (she still maxes Q in lane, then shield), so she will be a bit more annoying.</p>

					<p class="buff">Lulu Nerf - Shorter Speed Buffs</p>
						<p>Lulu's Whimsy on friendly targets (the massive movement speed increase) now has a maximum of 4 seconds at max ranks and a lower % movement speed based on AP.</p>
						<p>This means that Lulu mids won't be zipping around the map as often or as quickly.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.5 (Mar 9 - Mar 23)</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.5 is a smaller patch that doesn't have too much of an impact for Support Zilean, except for the two champions below.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">

					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Change - Attack Speed Nerf</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw got his attack speed per level buffed, but removed the passive bonus from his W to compensate. This means that instead of having a massive amount of attack speed at 9 (when W was maxed), you have to continue leveling up to reach the point where it was before.</p>
				</li>

					<p class="nerf">Soraka Change - Damage and Healing</p>
						<p>These changes have been in the works for some time now, and laning against Soraka before was frustrating. Now, her base heal is weaker and she is more reliant on landing her Starcall (Q) for self-sustain.</p>
						<p>With that being said, if Soraka lands her Starcall, her W heal will be even more powerful than previous patches. This means Soraka players should play more aggressively, instead of being a healbot. Soraka will likely win the trades, as the healing from her Q is really good.</p>
						<p>Personally, I like these changes and make her more dynamic to play with and against. But she is much harder to lane against now.</p>
