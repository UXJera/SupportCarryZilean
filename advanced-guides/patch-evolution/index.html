			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<h4>Support Zilean Tier Ranking (6.24): B+</h4>
					<p>At the end of Season 6, Support Zilean was in a very rough spot with the amount of hyper aggressive supports and long range AD Carries.</p>
					<h5>Enemy champions to watch out for:</h5>

					</div>
					<p>These factors made it extremely difficult it was to lose lane gracefully while still being impactful to the game.</p>
					<p>The Preseason 7 changes made assassins much more dangerous than previously, and increased their popularity. For most ADC's, assassins are the bane of their existance. Unless there is a Zilean around.</p>
					<p>I would argue that Support Zilean is one of the best answers to assassins for ADCs. The punishment for failing an assassination is brutal; and can quickly turn an even teamfight to a 5v4 in your favor.</p>
					<p>Overall, Support Zilean is an excellent mid-game answer to assassins. Zilean still has tremendous difficulty against the super aggressive lanes, but can flexible (offensively or defensively) against many bot lane matches.</p>

			<h3 id="/patch622">Preseason Patch 6.24</h3>
			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-624-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.24 is the final patch of 2016 and the last patch before 7.1. This patch is larger than the previous one, but focuses more on "pruning" certain jungle characteristics. There isn't much change regarding the bottom lane directly, except that the major change is that the enemy jungler will not be able to get level 3 off of Red + Krugs (golems) while you are working on your second wave.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Ivern - Weaker Sheilds</span></p>
					<p>Most of the time, you'll run into Ivern in the jungle, but he can uncommonly be played as a support.</p>
					<p>While Ivern support is much much weaker than Ivern jungle, the playstyle is similar: shield allies, connect root for ganks, deny vision with brush.</p>
					<p>The nerfs to his shield increase the mana of each shield (from 50 to 70) and reduce the slowing effect when the shield detonates. This makes it easier to escape and forces Ivern to manage his mana more during long fights.</p>
					<p>Against Ivern, Support Zilean has an edge if playing with an aggressive lane partner. Forcing Ivern support to the turret makes his brush skill useless. With higher mana costs, his shield won't outscale Zilean's Time Bomb (maxing Q of course). And always always always remember to focus down Daisy as soon as possible. She can paralyze your team with constant knock-ups and gradual damage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Kog'Maw - More AD less AP</span></p>
					<p>In recent patches, Kog'Maw was given buffs that powered up the AP Mid Lane Kog, but did little to help out the little guy in the bottom lane.</p>
					<p>In 6.24, Kog'Maw got a 1% increase per rank to his on-hit damage while Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) is active, meaning he is up to 7% maximum health damage at max ranks.</p>
					<p>On the other side, Kog'Maw lost a substantial damage from his Void Ooze (E), lowering the burst power from AP Kog.</p>
					<p>These changes help Kog'Maw in the bottom lane and serve as another alternative to Vayne when dealing with a multi-tank team (while running a protect the Kog comp). Zilean pairs well with Kog (and does well against), so these are welcome changes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/twitch.png" alt="Twitch Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Twitch - Lower Passive Damage</span></p>
					<p>The big change to Twitch is that the Damage over Time from his passive lost 1 damage per stack, capping at 5 damage per stack from 6. This minor adjustment does take away a good chunk of his trading damage.</p>
					<p>The second nerf is that his Venom Cask (W) which procs his passive took a mana increase. Normally, throwing a Cask to zone away the ADC cost little for Twitch, but made a big difference when 2-3 stacks of his passive would be applied without dealing direct damage, and Contaminate (E) dealing a large burst of damage from a safe distance.</p>
					<p>Twitch is tricky for Zilean to deal with (while invisible), but is manageble when you are in range to Double Bomb. Twitch is has very high sustained DPS, so you want to drop the Double Bombs, get some poke with the ADC, and either go in for the kill or back away.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/varus.png" alt="Varus Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Varus - Empowered Passive</span></p>
					<p>The change to Varus' passive, Living Vengeance, increases his attack speed by 25% for 5 seconds when he kills a creep or enemy. The change doubles the attack speed increase if Varus gets a kill or assist.</p>
					<p>This is a small quality of life change to help Varus out, although he is likely to still only see play in the mid lane at higher elo.</p>
					<p>The change to the Varus passive does not change the general dynamic of Varus/Zilean, but serves as a change that may make him more popular to play against the longer ranged ADCs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/vayne.png" alt="Vayne Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Vayne - Reduced Tumble Damage</span></p>
					<p>You may not have seen many Vaynes in your games, but that is probably because she is banned in most Gold+ elo games.</p>
					<p>Vayne was a bit out of control, but the changes take down the total bonus AD into Tumble from a .7 ratio to a .5. Vayne will still hurt, but her damage from Tumble will be much lower as she builds more AD.</p>
					<p>Vayne is a highly favorable matchup for and against Zilean because of Time Warp (E), and this might be enough of a nerf to take her off the permaban list.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/rylais64.png" alt="Rylai's Crystal Scepter Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Rylai's Crystal Scepter - Normalized Slow</span></p>
					<p>Rylai's is a rare buy for Zilean in general, but the nerfs to Rylai's stats and slow do not impact Zilean as much.</p>
					<p>With that being said, Rylai's lost 100hp and 25AP, but took a price cut down to 2600. The most meaningful change is that the old multi-conditional slow is now normalized to 20% in all cases. This means Damage over Time champions will get more value from the Ryali's slow.</p>
					<p>There are some Zilean's that prefer this item (usually in the Top Lane), but it is not a high priority for Support Zilean. These changes greatly harm some of the more oppressive mid lane champions (Azir, Syndra, Leblanc) making it easier to escape if you are caught out.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/res312.png" alt="Courage of Colossus Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Courage of the Colossus - Weaker early game</span></p>
					<p>Courage of the Colossus is a strong initiator mastery that is very strong in the bottom lane (Thresh, Braum, Alistar, Leona, Nautilus). CotC now procs every 45 - 30 seconds (depending on level) and only provides a shield worth 5% of max HP per nearby enemy.</p>
					<p>This change is more impactful to the top lane and jungle, but does take away some of the safety from the bottom lane all-in at level 2 or 3. Once again, if you are in range to Double Bomb the ADC, that will always be your target if you are initiated upon in a 2v2 situation. Once the ADC is stunned, then you can evaluate if you need to pull back or focus down the ADC or support (if the enemy ADC abandons the support).</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-623-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.23 was a very small balance patch that was geared towards beefing up the jungle. Almost every change this patch was directed towards the Mid Lane or the Jungle, and offered little change in the bottom lane. There isn't much to address this patch, so we will wait for the next one and see what changes are in store for us.</p>

			<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> As we enter Season 7, Riot has decided to keep things fresh by mixing things up. Normally the jungle is the first thing to be put in the blender, and it has a side of assassins to boot. There were also item updates, mastery changes, and some minor champion updates that impact Zilean in the bottom lane. There's plenty to unpack here, and for more information, visit the dedicated guides for each subject for a more in-depth conversation.</p>

				<li>
					<p class=""><span>Assassin Update</span></p>
					<p>Rather than discussing each champion individually, this will be a holistic approach to understanding assassins.</p>
					<p>The goal of an assassin is to eliminate a high value target (ADC, Mid Lane) and quickly escape. For this to work, the assassin needs enough mobility to make it to the target and enough damage to kill the target; extra bonus points if the assassin can escape without dying.</p>
					<p>Zilean has ways to slow down the mobility of assassins (Double Bomb, Time Warp), and can negate fatal damage (Chronoshift), which greatly increases the difficulty of an assassination to the point where the assassin may not even be a factor in the game any longer.</p>
					<p>When an assassin is nearby, your job is to inhibit mobility and prevent the assassination burst damage. If you can do this, you're going to win more games, I guarantee it.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="">Goodbye Pink - Hello Control</p>
					<p>Another overhaul of the preseason is the division between "Camouflage" and "Invisibility".</p>
					<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-camouflage" target="_blank">Camouflage</a> is described as a longer stealth, which includes Evelynn, Twitch, and Rengar's stealths. In short, you can use the Control Ward to reveal the position (similar to the Sweeper Trinket), but not target.</p>
				 	<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-invisibility" target="_blank">Invisibility</a>, on the other hand, is not revealed by Control Wards or the Sweeper Trinket. These are the shorter duration stealths, such as Vayne's ultimate + Tumble or Talon's ultimate. The only way to reveal these effects is true vision from the turret.</p>
					<p><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-622-notes#patch-shimmer" target="_blank">Shimmer</a> is a new graphical effect that happens when an invisible or camo unit is damaged. It briefly reveals their position, but does not make them targetable. You can still Double Bomb invisible and camo targets, and now a shimmer effect will happen (along with Time Bomb's detonation animation).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="">Ward Warfare</p>
					<p>In the middle of Season 6, experience rewards were increased for killing wards, and now the experience rewards are increased further. Killing a ward grants 40 experience (or 26xp split between 2 players). This is a little more than an early lane caster minion, plus the vision denial. Just be aware that if the enemy does manage to kill a ward at level 1, they will hit level 2 a minion before you.</p>
				</li>

						<img src="/img/items/banner64.png" alt="Banner of Command Icon">
					</div>
					<p class="">Aegis of the Legion Items</p>
					<img src="/img/items/aegis64.png" alt="Aegis of the Legion Icon">
					<p>Even though Zilean occasinally built into Aegis of the Legion items, now the team utility of the item has been drastically reduced. Aegis now grants 30 Armor and 30 MR, no bonus health and no Magic Resist Aura. Magic Resist Auras are no longer a thing.</p>
					<img src="/img/items/locket64.png" alt="Locket of the Iron Solari Icon">
					<p>The big change to Locket of the Iron Solari is that the shield is much bigger now. 35+(35 * your level) means a 665 team shield at level 18. The sheild does decay over 2.5 seconds, but it can mitigate some immedate bursts of damage. Overall, this item is OK on Zilean, but shouldn't be mandatory yet. As the professional meta develops, this may become a core item for all supports across the board.</p>
					<img src="/img/items/banner64.png" alt="Banner of Command Icon">
					<p>Banner of Command is no longer an AP item, but a "tank" item. Again, it doesn't have the magic resist aura but it did retain the lane minion promotion mechanic. It builds out of an Aegis and a Glacial Shroud (instead of a Fiendish Codex). I believe this will become an even more situational item for Support Zilean, and Abyssal Scepter will take precedence in the core build order.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/redemption64.png" alt="Redemption Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Redemption</span></p>
					<p>This is an odd item which grants passive health and mana regen, 400 HP and an extra 10% CDR. The activable effect has a 2.5 second delayed beam that heals allies and damages enemies, and this item can be used when dead (OR IF YOU ARE RESSING FROM YOUR OWN ULT).</p>
					<p>This item is incredibly good and many utility based supports are taking this as thier 1st completed item after the upgraded Sightstone. I am also recommending that this is a solid 1st major item to be completed after sightstone.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mikaels64.png" alt="Mikael's Crucible Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Mikael's Crucible</span></p>
					<p>Mikael's Crucible was changed slightly in that it no longer heals when the active is used. Instead, it gives 40% increased movement speed and slow immunity for 2 seconds if a stun/root/taunt/fear/silence/slow was removed. The travel time for the item was removed as well.</p>
					<p>Along with these changes came a cheaper price tag, a buy of only 2100 total gold. There are some minor changes to the stats of this item, but overall these changes are positive for Support Zilean. Crucible is an incredibly powerful utility tool to help someone who is in trouble, and at the expense of the heal, you gain a stronger crowd control cleanse. I still believe this will be a mandatory utility support item.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/knightsvow64.png" alt="Knight's Vow Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Knight's Vow</span></p>
					<p>Knight's Vow is a tanky item that parallels Zeke's Harbinger but with a more defensive focus. Knight's takes some of the damage from your paired partner and redirects it to you. You are also healed by damage your partner does to enemy champions.</p>
					<p>At first glance, this does not look like the best fit for Zilean. Zilean should be OK with letting a teammate get bursted down; as long as Chronoshift is available. This is something to keep an eye out for on the enemy team.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div>
						<img src="/img/items/talisman64.png" alt="Talisman Icon">
						<img src="/img/items/oasis64.png" alt="Eye of the Oasis Icon">
					</div>
					<p class=""><span>Ancient Coin Upgraded Items - Lower Cost</span></p>
					<p>These two items took a major price reduction (Eye of the Oasis - 2200 -> 1900) and (Talisman of Ascension - 2500 -> 2400). Overall, I am not a fan of the activable upgrades from the starter support items, but the 300 gold off the Eye of the Oasis is quite nice, considering Eye of the Watchers (AP Variant) is priced at 2200 still.</p>
					<p>This means that the choice to start Ancient Coin over Spellthiefs will get you a faster upgraded Sightstone and lower the overall cost of the build (and probably net a more money in the long run). 300 gold is a big deal, especially since I highly recommend starting Tear of the Goddess as a first back item (instead of Sightstone or upgraded starter item).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/zekes64.png" alt="Zeke's Herald Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Zeke's Herald - Lower Cost</span></p>
					<p>Zeke's is an incredible item to pair with Zilean, and now it costs 100 gold less. While this won't make a huge difference in the timing and pricing of builds, it is a little advantage that you can use to empower your ADC sooner.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Abyssal Scepter</span></p>
					<p>Abyssal Scepter no longer reduces enemy MR by 20, but increases the magic damage enemies take by 10%. For the most part, this is a pretty welcome change, especially at later stages of the game when subtracting 20 MR still means the enemy has 60% mitigation through MR.</p>
					<p>With some of the item changes, Abyssal Scepter may be more desirable over the recently changed Banner of Command.</p>

				</div>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer111.png" alt="Fresh Blood">
					<p>NEW - Fresh Blood</p>
					<p>Your first basic attack against a champion deals an addition 10 + 1  per level (6s cooldown).</p>
					<p>This talent is actually amazing for ranged harass supports. If you do decide to delve into Ferocity, this is probably the talent of choice. Also, watch out for extra damage from enemy supports as well because of this.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer212.png" alt="Double Edged Sword">
					<p>MOVED - Double Edged Sword</p>
					<p>Your first basic attack against a champion deals an addition 10 + 1  per level (6s cooldown).</p>
					<p>Double Edged Sword now deals an extra 5% damage (taking in 2.5% more) and was moved down into the second keystone tier of the Ferocity tree.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer213.png" alt="Battle Trance">
					<p>NEW - Battle Trance</p>
					<p>Gain up to 5% increased damage over 5 seconds when in combat with enemy champions.</p>
					<p>This seems more reliable for longer engagements and is much safer than Double Edge Sword. But I still do not recommend going this deep into Ferocity for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/fer311.png" alt="Fervor of Battle">
					<p>Fervor of Battle</p>
					<p>The big change to this is that the damage does much less per hit, but stacks up to 10 (from 8). This is useful to be aware of in lane, because the damage shouldn't be as drastic in early level duels against harass AD Carries, most notably Ezreal.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun211.png" alt="Greenfather's Gift">
					<p>NEW - Greenfather's Gift</p>
					<p>Stepping into brush causes your next attack or ability to deal 3% of your target's current health as bonus magic damage (9s cooldown).</p>
					<p>This is an interesting ability that works for ranged supports who want to get a side brush advantage, and also for junglers.</p>
					<p>As far as damage output goes, it doesn't seem to be that strong. A 600 health target would take 18 damage before magic resist is factored, leading to a peasly 12 damage extra. Of course this scales better into the game, but Bandit should still be the talent of choice for supports.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res113.png" alt="Siegemaster">
					<p>NEW - Siegemaster</p>
					<p>Gain 8 Armor and MR when near an allied tower.</p>
					<p>This is a dynamic talent that you would probably want to take when you know you are against a heavy poke lane and are going to be huddling by your turret.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res213.png" alt="Fearless">
					<p>NEW - Fearless</p>
					<p>Temporarily gain extra Armor and MR when hit by enemy champion.</p>
					<p>This talent isn't good for Zilean since he should not be getting hit, and also his armorMR values shouldn't be that significant. Leave this talent for the tanks.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="mastery-icon-circle">
					<img src="/img/masteries/res312.png" alt="Courage of the Colossus">
					<p>NEW - Courage of the Colossus</p>
					<p>Gain a temporary shield after hitting an enemy with hard CC. This can stack multiple times if multiple enemies are hit with the same CC.</p>
					<p>CotC replaced Strength of Ages, so no need to worry. This talent makes certain champions formidible in the mid to late game, most notably Alistar. This talent is best left for initiators, which Support Zilean should not be.</p>

					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Alistar - Skill mixup</span></p>
					<p>Passive: Alistar now heals when he has 7 stacks of Triumphant, which are gained from minions dying and applying CC to enemy champs.</p>
					<p>Pulverize (Q) - No longer stuns after knock-up ends.</p>
					<p>Trample (E) - Damages units around every 0.5 seconds. Every enemy hit by Trample gives Alistar a stack. At 5 stacks, Alistar's next auto deals extra damage and stuns for 1 second.</p>
					<p>Unbreakable Will (R) - No longer gains extra AD during ultimate.</p>
					<p>These changes make Alistar harder to play now. His W+Q Combo now has less CC time, and needs to be paired with E in order to make up for the lost stun time from Q.</p>
					<p>Alistar is a fairly easy matchup for Zilean, so increasing the difficulty for that champion only helps Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/twitch.png" alt="Twitch Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Twitch - Mechanics Change</span></p>
					<p>Ambush (Q) - Now provides Camouflage for a longer duration, and gains bonus MS when near enemy that can't see him (or when there isn't a Control Ward around).</p>
					<p>Venom Cask (W) - The Cask leaves a cloud for 3 seconds that causes stacks of Deadly Poison.</p>
					<p>These changes don't do too much to change the playstyle of Twitch, only update him into the new Camouflage paradigm for Season 7.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
					<p class=""><span>Ivern - Better buff Ivern</span></p>
					<p>Rootcaller (Q) - Lower CD and made it easier for Ivern to jump to his target.</p>
					<p>Daisy! (R) - More health, higher intelligence.</p>
					<p>Ivern got another round of buffs, which is increased his winrate in the jungle. In the bottom lane, Ivern is pretty tricky to play against. You have to pay attention if he leaves lane, he may be trying to sneak away a jungle camp.</p>
