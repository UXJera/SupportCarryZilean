      <h3>Patch 6.21</h3>
      <p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-621-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
      <p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> As with most of the recent patches, there isn't much of a developmental change to champions, although the professional meta has influenced the solo queue style as of late (i.e. the emergence of Support Miss Fortune).</p>
      <ul class="patch-container">
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
          <p class="">Ivern Buff - Overall Improvements</p>
          <p>Upon release, Ivern was not a formidable champion. With the increases to base stats and other minor kit functionality, Support Ivern is an annoyance, but nothing too terrible to Support Zilean.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
          <p class="">Kog'Maw Buff - Better Living Artillery (R)</p>
          <p>While this balance change is more impactful for the midlane AP Kog'Maw, this change adds a bit more post-6 power to Kog'Maw in the bot lane as well.</p>
          <p>The changes to Kog'Maw for Support Zilean make Kog'Maw more able to hold his own in case you decide to roam around the map, but don't forget to leave enough wards to keep the Kog'Maw alert.</p>

      <p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-620-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
      <p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Many of the recent patches (and probably a few more to come) will be incredibly light in balance; as the development team is focusing on the Season 7 changes, which include the new jungle and assassin update.</p>
      <ul class="patch-container">
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/ivern.png" alt="Ivern Icon">
          <p class="">Ivern Release</p>
          <p>At this time, Support Ivern seems extremely weak. If he takes Smite, you don't have to worry about a summoner spell in lane. It's similar to how Amumu would play, except he has a shield and can create brush in lane (so watch out if he pairs with Caitlyn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Ashe Icon">
          <p class="">Ashe Buffs - Passive and Q Change</p>
          <p>The first change brings more consistency to the slow from her passive and adds in critical slow (3x the base slow).</p>
          <p>The second change is to her Ranger's Focus (Q) activation no longer resetting the auto attack on activation. This lowers the burst from her Q and makes it less punishing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/jinx.png" alt="Jinx Icon">
          <p class="">Jinx Nerfs - Flame Chompers (E)</p>
          <p>The Flame Chomper traps now to less damage, cost more to cast, and only trigger damage from a single trap (instead of being hit by multiple traps).</p>

      <p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-620-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
      <p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Many of the recent patches (and probably a few more to come) will be incredibly light in balance; as the development team is focusing on the Season 7 changes, which include the new jungle and assassin update.</p>
      <ul class="patch-container">
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
          <p class="">Kog'Maw Changes</p>
          <p>Kog'Maw had his Q and W changed, yet again. The passive attack speed which was originally on Q, then was shifted to W, is now returned to Q.</p>
          <p>Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) has higher base range, deals a bit more %-health damage (without any flat magic added), a longer duration (8 seconds), and finally a change that causes the cooldown of W to start on the cast of Bio-Arcane Barrage, instead of at the end of the spell duration.</p>
          <p>These changes make Kog'Maw a bit stronger in context, which is always a positive thing because Support Zilean's mobility pairs well with Kog'Maw artillery.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
          <p class="">Corki Buffs - AD Scaling Increased</p>
          <p>Corki got a small bump to his AD per level, but this is a very minor buff.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
          <p class="">Soraka Nerfs - Astral Infusion Cooldown (W)</p>
          <p>Soraka's main heal (W) now has a longer base cooldown at lower ranks. Traditionally, many Soraka's would max Starcall (Q) and poke out, and be able to heal just fine. Now, this change lowers her overall healing output in lane, allowing for some poke to stick during.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/twitch.png" alt="Twitch Icon">
          <p class="">Twitch Nerf - Ambush Attack Speed Lowered (Q)</p>
          <p>The later skill ranks of Ambush's Attack Speed Increase was lowered from 70% down to 50%. This only affects the mid to late game of Twitch and doesn't impact the laning phase for Support Zilean.</p>

      <p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-618-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
      <p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.18 is a minor balance patch that doesn't change too much for Support Zilean. There are a couple of off-meta picks that gained some traction, and a couple of changes to ADC. All in all, there isn't much change from the previous patch to this patch.</p>
      <ul class="patch-container">
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Ashe Icon">
          <p class="buff">Ashe Nerf - Longer Volley Cooldown (W)</p>
          <p>Ashe took another nerf on her Volley (W) and has a higher cooldown for all ranks, although it isn't as noticable at higher ranks.</p>
          <p>This is another nerf given to Ashe after being nerfed in previous patches. She is still a strong pick, but not as strong as say 6.14 Ashe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
          <p class="">Lulu Fix - 2s duration slow @ all ranks</p>
          <p>A few patches ago Lulu's Glitterlance was changed to drastically lower the damage on her Glitterlance (Q), but provide a decaying 2 second slow at all ranks, which means that support Lulu would max her E first.</p>
          <p>This is a fix that wasn't properly implemented, so Lulu should have a more potent slow in this patch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/lux.png" alt="Lux Icon">
          <p class="">Lux Buff - Increased Slow on E</p>
          <p>Lux is an uncommon pick in the bottom lane, but still sees play in solo queue as support from time to time. Lucent Singularity (E) is the skill where she throws a light field on the ground (which slows) and can recall it to deal AoE damage for those units inside the circle.</p>
          <p>The slow increase is a very minor change that shouldn't affect how you play against that champion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="/img/champion/missfortune.png" alt="Miss Fortune Icon">
          <p class="buff">Miss Fortune Buff - Passive and Towers</p>
          <p>Miss Fortune's passive, Love Tap, deals extra damage on the first hit that you make against a target, meaning that you can do extra damage to every attack if you alternate hitting certain creeps. Previously, this bonus damage would only apply half damage to turrets, and now is changed to full damage.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that her passive doesn't apply that much damage, so she may only be gaining an extra 10 magic damage to towers during lane.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.17</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-616-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.17 is a moderate balance patch that nerfs some of the more powerful picks in recent times and buffs several of the weaker champions in that role, in order to increase diversity. For instance, Jihn, Ashe and Sivir (three of the top competitive ADCs) had nerfs, while Jinx, Vayne and Draven recieved minor buffs.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ashe Nerf - Weaker Q/R</p>
					<p>For Zilean, Ashe has recently become difficult to deal with because of her relentless slows and DPS from her stacked Rangers Focus (Q). The change to Q is a revision to a few patches ago when Ashe was not as popular.</p>
					<p>The second nerf is to the magic damage from her ultimate. Since Ashe usually leads with her ultimate, it should be easier to time out her burst so you can get a good Zilean ult to save the frozen target.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Nautilus Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Jihn Nerf - Lower damage on W/R</p>
					<p>Jihn/Zilean is one of my favorite lanes, but going against Jihn is very tough. Jihn will still be a strong laner, but his long range poke was toned down.</p>
					<p>The first nerf is to his W, the long range bullet that can snare. Usually, this move is used to pick off a target off screen without using ult.</p>
					<p>The second nerf is to his ultimate, lowering the minimum and maximum damage. Also, his ultimate is no longer refunded cooldown if it is cancelled early.</p>
					<p>In short, Jihn's standard lane damage is the same, but his longer range attacks are weaker.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/sivir.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="buff">Sivir Nerf - Ricochet (W) nerfs</p>
					<p>Sivir's W took a reduction to base AD, but it was a slight nerf. She still has incredible wave clear. The second nerf to Ricochet was the passive attack speed increase with ranks in On The Hunt (R).</p>
					<p>This doesn't change much about Sivir, aside from a slightly slower wave clear.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/draven.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Draven Buff - Whirling Death buff</p>
					<p>Draven's ult recieved a small buff with lower mana cost, but a higher CD at rank 1 and lower CD at rank 3.</p>
					<p>Draven is super snowbally, so this does make him slightly weaker in damage, but alternatively, Draven will be able to throw out his ult with less mana (he does burn through mana quickly), which makes it more challenging to lane against.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ezreal.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Ezreal Buff - Stronger Passive</p>
					<p>Riot buffed Ezreal's passive to improve his attack speed from a maximum of a 50% bonus to a 70% bonus.</p>
					<p>This may improve the popularity of Ezreal, which is a horrendous matchup for and against Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/gangplank.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Gangplank Nerf - Lower Ult Damage</p>
					<p>Even though Gangplank is not a matchup you should ever encounter in the bottom lane, his influence around the map from his Global Ultimate is something that directly impacts the laning for Support Zilean.</p>
					<p>The lowered damage and longer ult CD gives a slight reprieve in the bottom lane, and allows you to not have to be as afraid of all-ins around level 4-5.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jinx.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Jinx Buff - Stronger Ultimate</p>
					<p>This slight buff increases the bonus AD on her ultimate, making it just a little stronger. This is a slight buff but may not be enough to make her a popular pick. But I do enjoy playing with and against her, she is a fun laner.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/morgana.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Morgana Buff - Longer Black Shield Range</p>
					<p>Morgana got a 50 range increase on her Black Shield, making it safer to apply her shield without getting too deep into the fold. This is a minor buff but doesn't change much about the overall mechanics of the kit nor how you should approach playing against a Morgana.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/thresh.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Thresh Buff - Shorter Ultimate CD</p>
					<p>Thresh's "The Box" now has a shorter cooldown, but overall no other changes to the spell.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/trundle.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Trundle Nerf - Adjusted Pillar CD</p>
					<p>Support Trundle typically maxes Pillar of Ice first (because of the incredible CD you get from ranks), and loses about 3 seconds off the CD with this change at max ranks.</p>
					<p>This may mean that Support Trundles may end up splitting points between Q and E during the lane phase.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/vayne.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Vayne Buff - Tumble Damage Up</p>
					<p>Vayne's Tumble has an increase in AD ratio, making her AD itemization more worthwhile. It's a bit strange, because Vayne typically builds 2 to 3 attack speed items before going into the heavier AD damage items.</p>
					<p>This change just makes her a bit more snowbally until the 4-5 item threshhold where she will be much stronger than previous patches.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.16 (Aug 9 - Aug 23)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-616-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.16 is a small patch and is going to be one of the final patches before the Assassin Update / Worlds Meta Update. There are a few big changes that impact the possible bottom lane matchups, so here's what we have in store for you over the next couple of weeks.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="">Lulu Buff - Better Whimsy (W)</p>
					<p>Whimsy is the polymorph/steroid, and the base cooldown was lover 2 seconds, but remains the same at max ranks. This means that it can have a higher uptime during lane, but it does cost quite a bit of mana and Lulu does have early issues with mana.</p>
					<p>The second part is that the attack speed bonus from Whimsy got a flat 10% increase across the board. At max ranks, she gives 45% increased attack speed, which is the same as an extra Phantom Dancer worth of attack speed, so this is kind of a big deal.</p>
					<p>Lulu laning is much less pokey since the her Glitterlance (Q) was changed, but she will be even meaner when it comes to late game utility.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nautilus.png" alt="Nautilus Icon">
					<p class="">Nautilus Buff - New Ultimate Interaction</p>
					<p>Nautilus' ultimate, Depth Charge, now has a stun element and an increased knockup, giving even more crowd control to an already stacked champion.</p>
					<p>This could be one of those champions that quickly sees nerfs to the ultimate (because it is really really strong now), or he will rise in popularity in the top lane.</p>
					<p>Zilean vs. Nautilus matchup is tough for Zilean, because Nautilus' shield mitigate damage from bombs, and the CC chain from Nautilus will leave Zilean at low HP with summoners blown. Now he has an extra tool to his kit, but if you conserve your Time Warp (E) you can manage to get out of the way or speed an ally away from the group.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/sona.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="buff">Sona Nerf - Speed and CDR</p>
					<p>Sona has been a dominant pick in solo queue for the past couple of patches and was taken down a peg with lower mobility and less passive utility from her ultimate.</p>
					<p>Sona's mobility song lost 3% movement speed in all ranks and her ultimate now has basic cooldown reduction set at 10/25/40, evening out the power until she gains more levels.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Patch 6.15 (Jul 26 - Aug 9)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-615-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.15 isn't a significant patch and mostly tones down several strong champions and buffs some of the less played champions.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/braum.png" alt="Braum Icon">
					<p class="buff">Braum Nerf - Lower damage</p>
					<p>Braum took a nerf to the base damage of his passive and Q, but there were no changes to the crowd control that these abilities have.</p>
					<p>Braum isn't too much of a threat in lane as Zilean, but these nerfs are welcomed.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="">Corki Buff - Shorter Passive CD</p>
					<p>Corki's Package passive went from a 5 minute cooldown to a 4 minute cooldown. This is a neutral change that may bring Corki back into popularity (likely mid).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<p class="buff">Karma Nerf - Shield Nerfs</p>
					<p>Karma can no longer shield minions, and her empowered shield only gives a 60% movement speed burst if the skill is maxed. This lowers the overall mobility of Karma and makes it so that she can no longer "deny" last hits by shielding them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/vayne.png" alt="Vayne Icon">
					<p class="buff">Vayne Buff - Tumble Buffs</p>
					<p>Vayne's Tumble (Q) now does extra damage to towers. Additionally, the crit chance was normalized so that Tumble and the Auto-Attack share the same crit range (instead of each being independent of eachother.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="">Zyra Buff - Q Scaling</p>
					<p>Zyra's Deadly Spines (Q) now has higher damage at max ranks and a higher AP ratio. There was not an increase to the plant ratios and damage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mikaels64.png" alt="Mikael's Icon">
					<p class="">Mikael's Crucible & Ardent Censer - Unique Passive</p>
					<p>Before, you could buy multiple of the same item and get rediculous amounts of shield/heal scaling. Thus, now the two items have a unique passive that does not stack with eachother, but still grants the 15% heal and shield power.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.14 (Jul 12 - Jul 26)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-614-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.14 is a patch that includes the Ryze "rework" along with some changes to a handfull of support champions. All in all, this isn't that significant of a patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/leona.png" alt="Leona Icon">
					<p class="">Leona Changes - Lower CDs, lower damage</p>
					<p>Leona has always been a tough early game match up for Zilean, but this may make it a little easier. Starting off, Leona's passive, Q, W, and R do less damage individually.</p>
					<p>Shield of Daybreak (the stun) has a lower cooldown and longer range. The stun duration was also hotfixed to 1 second (instead of 1.25). Zenith Blade (the dash) now has a longer root (.25 to .5), so Leona still has the same amount of CC duration with a combo.</p>
					<p>Eclipse (W) now does 10 damage less per rank. Solar Flare (R) now empowers the Leona's next 3 auto attacks, which have increased range, deal extra damage, and apply the Leona passive. This means that the burst from her ultimate is going to be pretty nasty on a single target.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/sona.png" alt="Sona Icon">
					<p class="">Sona Changes - Auras and Spamming</p>
					<p>Starting off, Sona has a passive on her Ultimate that reduces the cooldown of her basic spells. Keep in mind that the mana cost of Sona's spells are incredibly expensive and spamming isn't an option unless you build for it accordingly.</p>
					<p>Hymn of Valor (Q) does less damage, and rightfully so since it will have a massive amount of cooldown with ultimate ranks.</p>
					<p>Aria of Preserverance (W) now heals more and has a higher ratio, which may entice players into maxing W first on Sona. Also, the empowered W auto attack does even more damage reduction from the enemy struck.</p>
					<p>Song of Celerity (E) has an even higher movement speed increase, and a longer duration out of combat, which means that her roaming ability is increased.</p>

			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-613-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.13 is a balance patch that looks to alter several of the supports (and starting support items).</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/blitzcrank.png" alt="Blitzcrank Icon">
					<p class="">Blitzcrank Changes - Hook, Knock Up, and Ultimate</p>
					<p>The first change to Blitz is that his pull doesn't pull you as far back, and moves you 75 units in front of Blitz, but this still means he is in auto attack range, but no longer can pull you onto traps.</p>
					<p>The second change is that his Power Fist (E) knockup has a 5 second duration of charge (down from 10) and the auto cannot be cancelled. I've played a fair bit of Blitz in the past, and this should mean that when he hooks you, he will be able to land the knock up punch easier.</p>
					<p>The final change is to his ultimate passive, which randomly damages enemies every so often. This would reveal Blitz in the bush and cancel the movespeed from Boots of Mobility. So now, the passive only procs when Blitzcrank is in combat. So he can now hide in the bush at level 6 and that is something you have to be extra mindful of.</p>

					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Lulu Buffs - Glitterlance Damage, Whimsy Buff</p>
					<p>Lulu isn't a common pick, and this is a pretty harsh nerf to her early lane harassment. The Glitterlance (Q) only deals 70% damage after its first target, but it has a 2 second decaying slow.</p>
					<p>The next part of her kit that was changed is that her Whimsy (W) now grants bonus attack speed to champions, similar to Nunu's Blood Boil.</p>
					<p>Overall, this reduces her poke and carry potential, and should be easier to deal with in lane as a Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Tahm Kench Buffs - Overall Kit Buffs</p>
					<p>Putting aside my hate of Tahm for a moment, these buffs were made to reduce the clunkiness of his kit.</p>
					<p>The first is that the passive from his ultimate (% based HP added to autos as magic damage) was transfered to his natural passive at level 1. The damage is increased per stack of the fish debuff that gets on you, and does more damage overall.</p>
					<p>The damage from his Tongue Last (Q) was increased by 5 per rank, which doesn't change too much. The shield from his Thick Skin (E) was changed a bit, so now the grey health shield is much weaker until points are invested into it. Also, the shield lasts 3 seconds (down from 6) so he is burstable.</p>
					<p>The final change was to Tahm's Ultimate, where it moves much quicker and is harder to walk away from. Before, you could see the Tahm ultimate on the ground, and simply walk away. Now there is a half second reduction before the ultimate is noticable by the enemy team, so your team has to be much more alert for that ultimate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/thresh.png" alt="Thresh Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Thresh Changes - Dark Passage Ratio Change</p>
					<p>This is a slight change to Thresh, where souls now increase the sheild strength ratio of Thresh. This will increase the overall strength of the sheild granted from the lantern, but not by a large amount. I would like to say that in a given game, you can expect between 50-80 souls to be collected.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="buff">Zyra Nerfs - Plants and Spawning</p>
					<p>This nerf for Zyra was aimed to decrease the number of plants that Zyra could get out over time, her passive and Rampant Growth (W) now have increased cooldowns so fewer seeds should spawn.</p>
					<p>The second change is a bug fix where plants that were spawned with Deadly Spines (Q) would start attacking the closest champion, even if Zyra did not damage them. This takes some of the poke potential away from Zyra during lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zilean.png" alt="Zilean Icon">
					<p class="buff">Zilean Bug fix - Chronoshift and On-Heal Effects</p>
					<p>Whenever I see a Zilean change in the patch notes, I prepare myself for the worst. However, this is a minor change that doesn't effect the Zilean playstyle much (or at least the item builds that I advocate).</p>
					<p>The change was simple, Chronoshift now applies the effects of Athene's Unholy Grail, Ardent Censer, and other healing bonus steps. I do not expect this to revolutionize how Zilean is played, as those items are far too situational for Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ancient_coin64.png" alt="Ancient Coin Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ancient Coin - 5% CDR</p>
					<p>This is a modest change to this item, and is currently the only item in the game that gives 5% CDR. Even with the 5% CDR onto the item, I still believe that Spellthief's is the best option unless you are going against a lane with heavy poke and you are anticipating the need for additional sustain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/nomad64.png" alt="Nomad's Medallion Icon">
					<p class="buff">Nomad's Medallion - 10% CDR and More Mana Regen</p>
					<p>Nomad's now has 10% CDR built into it, and has more mana regen with fewer health regen. The mana regen is now equal to Frostfang, which means that if you are against a heavy poke lane or you do not think you'll be able to harass the enemy much, then this is a reasonable item to purchase.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/talisman64.png" alt="Talisman of Ascention Icon">
					<p class="buff">Talisman of Ascention - Armor + Situational MS</p>
					<p>The change to Talisman now changes the build path to a Raptor's Cloak, which gives extra movement speed around turrets. With that change, you also get a hefty 45 extra armor added to this item. The cost of the item was increased to 2500, which puts it 300g over the other completed support items. This makes it much less reasonable to buy early on, and you may consider holding off on upgrading this until you're doing much more grouping or roaming around the map.</p>
					<p>I still believe that the Nomad's + Sightstone upgrade is the better choice to make based on item slot efficiency.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Spellthief's Edge Icon">
					<p class="buff">Spellthief's Edge line - Tribute Enhancements</p>
					<p>This change to the Spellthief item line now makes it so that if you kill a pet (Zyra plants), your tribute will not lock itself out. This is a nice quality of life change that doesn't punish us for clearing away Zyra plants.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spellthief64.png" alt="Spellthief's Edge Icon">

				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/idol64.png" alt="Forbidden Idol Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Forbidden Idol - Price Hike and Healing</p>
					<p>Forbidden Idol is being shifted towards healing centric items, and has a price increase up to 850g. This item isn't as cost efficient if you are planning to build Mikael's Crucible, so you will have to choose the value of 10% CDR or the health/mana regen from Chalice of Harmony.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mikaels64.png" alt="Mikael's Crucible Icon">
					<p class="buff">Mikael's Crucible - Price Hike and Extra Healing</p>
					<p>Mikael's now costs an extra 100g to complete, but with the bugfix to Zilean and healing, your ultimate now heals an extra 15% life upon revival.</p>
					<p>So let's take a moment to appreciate this. Zilean's ultimate has a 200% AP ratio, along with a huge life gane on revival. In previous patches, a rank 2 ultimate with 150 AP would revive back at 1150 HP. In the current patch, with those same numbers, the revive would heal back 1322, which is an extra 170 HP just by having this item.</p>
					<p>Now I don't think that every game should be a Mikael's rush, or even a game where you would want to take this item, but this adds a fair chunk of gold value to an item that you may have purchased anyways.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/ruby64.png" alt="Ruby Sightstone Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Ruby Sightstone - Price Decrease and more Item CDR</p>
					<p>Ruby Sightstone now only costs 1600g, which is an extra 800 after the item is first bought. Additionally, the Item Cooldown Reduction is now 20%. This is an appetizing buy for Zilean, because you have the potential to have several activatible items in your build: Frost Queen's Claim or Talisman of Ascention, Zeke's Harbinger, Banner of Command or Locket of the Iron Solari, Seraph's Embrace.</p>
					<p>The changes also makes this Sightstone the cheapest to upgrade, which gives you more money for other items. But generally, the Ruby Sightstone is one of the later upgrades in the game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/trinket_ward64.png" alt="Ward Icon">
					<p class="buff">Wards - Ward Kills Give XP</p>
					<p>Wards now grant 30 XP when killed (but it isn't clarified if it is locally shared, or only given to the person who makes the final blow) and attacking a ward will not put into combat if using Boots of Mobility or the Cloud Drake buff.</p>
					<p>The big deal is that you get an extra 30 XP per ward kill, which is about the shared experience for a single minion. While this doesn't seem like much, with Zilean's passive you can quickly gain the XP lead if you are vigilant.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.12 (Jun 14 - Jun 29)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.12 mainly adjusted masteries, AD itemization, and the buffing of a few weaker champions. The one thing to note for this patch is that there are some improvements to some of the masteries in the Resolve (defense) tree that may make it better for most Zilean supports.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<p class="">AD Itemization Changes</p>
					<p>In short, the AD itemization is to move away from Ghostblade and move towards Infinity Edge and Essence Reaver as a first item. The next change is improving the power on Last Whisper items to have higher base AD, making it a priority 4th item (much like it was in season's past).</p>
					<p>The purpose of this is to diversify the AD champion pool, however there are still some champions whose strengths are greater than the itemization improvements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Corki Buff - Gatling Gun buffs</p>
					<p>Riot has been giving Corki some extra love these past few patches, and this one is no different. The big change this patch is that the armor shred last longer and is refreshed if triggered at full stacks. This means that Corki's Gatling Gun will be stronger if he jumps onto you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/res22.png" alt="Veteran Scars Icon">
					<p class="buff">Veteran Scars - +5 HP at max ranks</p>
					<p>Of the mastery changes, this is the only adjustment to make note of. The change adds just a tad bit of HP to lane, which makes it quite valuable (worth 6 yellow HP runes, or 2 HP quints). Granted, this change only reinforces a safer playstyle and does not make one mastery set up superior to the other.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.11 (Jun 2 - Jun 14)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-611-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.11 is mostly a nerf patch to some of the strongest champions in League. Many of the Top Tier Competitive Champs (Azir, Ekko, Kindred, Lucian, Nidalee, Ryze, Swain, Zed) took some big nerfs. But since we're focusing on Support Zilean matchups, many things in this patch don't impact the bottom lane directly.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="">Corki Buff - Ultimate AD Ratios</p>
					<p>This is a subtle bump to Corki's Missile Barrage, making it slightly stronger. At this point, I welcome a wider champion diversity in the bottom lane, instead of Lucian/Caitlyn/Ezreal in every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian Nerf - Q Damage and Range</p>
					<p>Lucian needs nerfs. There are very few who disagree with this. The big difference is that in lane, he will have a harder time aiming his Q to pass through minions and hit those funky angles that cause you or your ADC to take a modest amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The scaling on his Q was also lowered, but he can still pump out tons of damage when he gets enough CDR and mobility. The Ghostblade/Black Cleaver has become the staple build, which gives him plenty of CDR, mobility, and armor shred.</p>
					<p>Maybe I'm just a little frustrated having to play with or against this champ every game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz Buff - Longer Q slow, Ultimate can stack passive</p>
					<p>These buffs make Vel'Koz even more playable, but his numbers are still low and dependent on landing a full combo.</p>
					<p>The change to his ultimate makes it forgiving so you can get a stack for every .7 seconds the person is in a beam. The channel duration is 2.5 seconds, so you shouldn't have to worry about the true damage unless you have 1 or 2 stacks on already.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Boots of Swiftness - 5 less Movespeed</p>
					<p>These boots take another nerf, which makes them only have 10 more Movespeed over other Tier 2 boots. The passive is really the only reason to pick up these boots now, and that is still a situational purchase.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is favorable, because the Swifties should be less common, and your slows more potent.</p>

			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a rather quiet patch. Many of the changes this patch are subtle buffs to the mid lane mages who didn't perform as admirably as Riot had hoped.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Ultimate Dmg Reduction down</p>
					<p>Alistar's Ultimate (at rank 1) now only halves damage for the duration, instead of 70%. Alistar still has incredible tower diving potential, he just has to be extra careful near the end of the duration to not take an extra tower shot when the ultimate fades.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="buff">Zyra Nerf - Passive Seed Change</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.9 (May 4 - May 18)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-69-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch is a major patch update that focuses on empowering many of the mid lane mages. Many of the champions have an overlap between mid and support, so things are going to be crazy this patch (as far as supports go). There are many things that I am speculating on, and I will likely revisit this page and the champion matchup page to give a better idea. Best of luck out there!</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/zyra.png" alt="Zyra Icon">
					<p class="">Zyra Rework</p>
					<p>For starters, the big change to Zyra is that she passively spawns seeds (rather than having to place them down). Additionally, plants of the same type deal 50% less damage to the same target, meaning that she wants to not cast her spells on a pile of seeds, but to drop seeds and spells simultaniously. The plants do a tiny bit less damage than previously.</p>
					<p>Outside of that, her Q was changed from a circular spell radius to a wall-type skillshot (like Malzahar's Q). The rest of her kit is similar to her old kit.</p>
					<p>So the big difference in playstyle is that you have to be mindful of where the seeds are, and be ready to step on them if you have the positioning to do so. She gets more plants, but will be doing overall less damage per plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/brand.png" alt="Brand Icon">
					<p class="">Brand Rework</p>
					<p>Brand's passive was the core change to his kit. Instead of doing the massive damage over time for landing a spell, there is a 3-stack passive on the target that detonates everything around the person affected. The passive does less damage per tick, and rewards players for getting off a full spell rotation (E-> Q stun -> W).</p>
					<p>Going through skill changes, the stun on Brand's Q was dropped from 2 seconds to 1.5 (this is huge). His ultimate now targets those who are Blazed (heh) and tries to detonate as many as possible.</p>
					<p>From my experience, this is a nerf to Brand in the bottom lane. He is much weaker in lane, and has far less of an impact in teamfights, due to his limited economy. If Brand can get ahead in the bottom lane, he will be in a much better position for teamfights.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/velkoz.png" alt="Vel'Koz Icon">
					<p class="">Vel'Koz "Rework"</p>
					<p>This isn't as much of a rework, and is more of a number switcheroo. Many of AP rations were adjusted (downward), but his passive gained an AP ratio. This means that landing a 3-stack combo is going to be an essential of the kit (I think there is a trend developing here).</p>
					<p>In bottom lane, Vel'Koz poke will hurt less. A lot less, as long as you can dodge skillshots.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/annie.png" alt="Annie Icon">
					<p class="">Annie Update</p>
					<p>The Annie changes look quite scary. Her W (cone spell) has increased range, and her shield now gives significant flat % damage reduction for 2.5 seconds.</p>
					<p>The big change is to Tibbers. Tibbers does slightly less impact damage, and has lower AP ratios. In exchange, Tibbers can regain health, gain extra movement speed running towards Annie, an Enrage effect that gives Tibbers an insane amount of Attack Speed (275% bonus AS) that decays over 3 seconds, the Enrage retriggers if her passive is triggered, AND chases down the killer of Annie.</p>
					<p>I fully expect Annie to make a huge comeback in the bottom lane. The key to success is to focus down the Tibbers ASAP, or run away if you don't die to a burst combo (Annie has one of the strongest level 6 All-Ins for a support).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/syndra.png" alt="Syndra Icon">
					<p class="">Syndra Update</p>
					<p>Syndra is one of those special bottom lane mages that I just love playing. She's incredibly strong, can do level 1 jungle shenanigans, has a powerful ranged stun, and does a surprising amount of damage.</p>
					<p>The big changes to Syndra is that she has can get more orbs out (with max Q), and can grab up to 3 orbs (max W). But the power in support Syndra is the max E. By having more orbs out (possibly 7 or 8 now), you do absurd amounts of damage with your ultimate. As a support, I've been able to 100 to 0 an AD carry at level 9 with minimal AP items (pre change).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerfs</p>
					<p>Soraka has been a major pain, and now has some minor nerfs to her Q (Starcall). The % slow was nerfed to a flat 30% and only grants 10% movement speed.</p>
					<p>Once again, this is a small change that lessens the offensive power of a mostly defensive champion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="buff">Taric Nerfs</p>
					<p>Taric receivced some nerfs to the range and width of his spells, making it tougher to land spells and chain abilities.</p>
					<p>An average Taric isn't scary, but a good Taric is a nightmare to play against. These nerfs should separate the boys from the men.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/tear64.png" alt="Tear of the Goddess Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tear of the Goddess Change</p>
					<p>The free bonus 25% mana regen is lowered to 0, but you regain 15% of your mana spent.</p>
					<p>For Support Zilean, this is a loss of about 1.7 mana per 5 and a gain a minimum of 23 mana returned per Q W Q combo, which is around a minute of mana regen from the bonus 25% mana regen alone. This makes a 1st buy Tear of the Goddess even more efficient in lane.</p>
					<p>The upgrade into Archangel's Staff returns 25% mana (up from 15% of Tear), which is huge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/chalice64.png" alt="Chalice Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Chalice of "Harmony" Change</p>
					<p>This might be an alternative to Tear (only 150 gold more), but you don't get the extra mana from Tear. The change also makes it versatile to aid sustain, so potions will not be as necessary if you pick this item up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Athene's Unholy Grail Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed and is no longer worthwhile on Zilean at all. The price of the item was significantly lowered, and is only useful for the hybrid regeneration and the 20% CDR. The other passive benefits healers and shielders, so you will NOT want to be going with this item going forward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morellonomicon Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Morellonomicon Change</p>
					<p>This item was changed to be 500 gold more expensive, more AP, no mana regen, proc Grievous Wounds at 35% (from 40%), but kills and assists restore 20% mana (similar to old Athene's). This item is the replacement for Athene's Unholy Grail, but still doesn't feel like the right fit for Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/abyssal64.png" alt="Abyssal Scepter Icon">
					<p class="">Abyssal Scepter Change</p>
					<p>Abyssal was changed to add 10% CDR and a scaling magic resist aura (along with a bump in MR). If you do want to add this item in your build, you need to account for the extra 10% CDR and drop it from somewhere else.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/zhonyas64.png" alt="Zhonya's Hourglass Icon">
					<p class="">Zhonya's Hourglass Change</p>
					<p>Zhonya's took a 600 gold price cut, and has an added 10% CDR. Some other stats were changed, but for Zilean, the CDR and price are the most important things to note. Once again, if you do want to go this item, be mindful of how much CDR you have in your build.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/pink64.png" alt="Vision Ward Icon">
					<p class="">Vision Ward Change</p>
					<p>Pink Wards now have 4 HP, but regain health when out of combat. This means that protecting wards is going to be more valuable, and you can expect more fights to break out around the ward. If you have the opportunity to save the ward, you should try to shove off the enemy, but do not risk your life for the value of a 75g ward.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/frostfang64.png" alt="Frostfang Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Frostfang Nerf</p>
					<p>Frostfang is taking a small 25% mana regen nerf, but I do not believe the Eye of the Watchers took a mana regen nerf. Ideally, this is a very small nerf (since you don't stay on Frostfang for long) that will negatively impact enemy laners more than Support Zilean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/coldgun64.png" alt="GLP 800 Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech GLP 800</p>
					<p>This is an interesting item that I am going to tinker with. It builds out of Catalyst (which was altered to be more consistent with sustain) and a Gunblade. The active is a conal 65% slow, which should serve as a way to get closer to land bombs and slows. The price of the item is 3000g, which is very expensive for a budget support.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/hextechbelt64.png" alt="Protobelt Icon">
					<p class="">Hextech Protobelt-01</p>
					<p>If you've ever played or watched DOTA 2, this item is a weaker version of Blink Dagger. This item is better suited for champions without a dash who want to engage, but also has defensive purposes. I wouldn't recommend getting this item on Zilean because his kit already has enough mobility in it (plus the Protobelt cannot jump over walls).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>General Macro Changes</p>
					<p>There are many more macro oriented changes that were added in this patch, including the Turret and Dragon reworks, but those have much larger implications on the game that go beyond the specialty of Support Zilean.</p>
					<p>Also, be prepared for some overpowered champions to appear in this patch, and watch them slowly get scaled back over the next 3 months.</p>

			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-68-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a minor balance patch with the reworked Taric included. And also, new Groovy Zilean artwork.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/taric.png" alt="Taric Icon">
					<p class="neutral">Taric Rework</p>
					<p>I fully expect Taric to be heavily banned for the first few weeks of patch 6.8, so play testing will be somewhat limited.</p>
					<p>Looking at his skills, there isn't too much to be afraid of, except his stun. Zilean shouldn't have much of a problem because of his speed increase and walking perpendicularly to the skillshot (otherwords, strafe 90 degrees in a direction that Taric is walking).</p>
					<p>His ultimate is more of a team awareness type of skill, but he can time his ultimate to stop a single Time Bomb of damage. All in all, Zilean has enough tools to contain the power of Taric.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Nerfs - Bio-Arcane Barrage (W) Lower Damage</p>
						<p>This nerf tones down the on-hit damage from Kog'Maw's W, making his early game even harder. His Caustic Spittle (Q) was given more Armor/MR shred at early levels, but Kog'Maw shouldn't be looking for early trades unless he has a sustain support.</p>
						<p>At most, this nerf causes Kog'Maw to lose a maximum of 50 DPS at 5.0 attack speed and max W ranks, which isn't too terrible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="buff">Miss Fortune Buff - Strut (W) Shorter CD</p>
						<p>This is a fun little change that increases the overall uptime of Strut (attack speed buff). In order to get the most of it, you have to auto-attack several different targets.</p>

					<p class="buff">Iceborn Gauntlet Nerf - Lower Proc Damage</p>
						<p>This item is a staple for the Blue Ezreal build, which is one of the hardest marksman to pair with and against Support Zilean.</p>
						<p>While the slow, CDR, mana, and armor are still a part of the item, this may disuade players from selecting Ezreal.</p>

			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-67-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch was mostly a nerf patch to some of the most popular picks.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/aurelion.png" alt="Aurelion Sol Icon">
					<p class="buff">Aurelion Sol Nerfs - Crowd Control</p>
					<p>Aurelion Sol was a bit obnoxious with the large crowd control he could put out.</p>
					<p>In this patch, his stun duration was cut down to a max of 1.5 seconds (with the same stun scaling as Zilean's Time Bomb); a nerf well deserved.</p>
					<p>Aurelion's ultimate took a big hit in the slow, which means escaping his orbs will be easier.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Jhin Nerfs - Dancing Grenade (Q)</p>
						<p>This nerf added a higher mana cost and lower damage on his Dancing Grenade, a common tool used for last hitting.</p>
						<p>This isn't a devestating nerf, but it will take away from some of the lane dominance that Jhin has when he gets ahead.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kindred.png" alt="Kindred Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kindred Nerfs - Ultimate is now Self-cast</p>
						<p>Although Kindred is uncommonly seen in the bottom lane, the change of her ultimate makes her positioning more critical to the success of the ability. Zilean and Kindred is a solid lane (even better when maxing Time Warp).</p>
						<p>The plus side of this is that Kindred should never miss an ult on herself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/poppy.png" alt="Poppy Icon">
					<p class="buff">Poppy Nerfs - Nerfs around the board</p>
						<p>It's no secret; Poppy was one of the strongest chapmions in the game for quite some time with the versatility to slot into 3 different positons.</p>
						<p>In short, Poppy got nerfs on her passive (shorter range), Hammer Shock - Q (lower base damage), and Heroic Charge - E (shorter charge range). The big one is the nerf on her charge range, meaning she doesn't knock back as far and has to be closer to use the skill.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="buff">Soraka Nerf - Mana Costs</p>
						<p>Soraka is still one of the most frustrating supports to lane against, because she effectively nullifies all poke and trade damage, while being able to put out a respectable amount herself.</p>
						<p>These nerfs are targeted for the laning phase so that her healing and damage output will be less than before. Personally, I don't think the nerfs go far enough to solve the Solo Q Soraka problem.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="neutral">Death Timers</p>
						<p>This change lowers the death timers from the 30-55 minute mark for all players.</p>
						<p>This is a neutral change, and could possibly be an indirect nerf to Zilean. Zilean has the ability to prevent a death, and possibly turn a fight around because of the wasted resources going for the kill.</p>
						<p>If you win the fight because of a revive and kill a few members of the enemy team, the amount of objectives that you can take is slightly lower.</p>
						<p>On the plus side, even if you die (as Zilean), you'll be able to get back into the game faster with lower death times. This is one of those situations where if you are playing Zilean perfectly, the lower death timers is a nerf against your team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.6 (Mar 23 - Apr 6)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-66-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch has a nice balance of nerfs to stronger/popular picks and buffs to lesser picked champs. For Support Zilean, there are several "sustain" supports that took a hit, but mostly junglers.
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar Nerf - Triumphant Roar (E) Reduction</p>
					<p>This was a subtle nerf to Alistar's sustain, lowering the healing to allies from 50% to 33%, which is a huge hit, considering that recently a longer cooldown was applied to his heal.</p>
					<p>Support Zilean doesn't typically have any problems with Alistar, and this will just push him to be more aggressive, rather than a passive healbot.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/janna.png" alt="Janna Icon">
					<p class="buff">Janna Nerfs - Shield and Ultimate</p>
						<p>The first nerf is a reduction on the flat AD bonus that she gives on her shield. Against Support Zilean, she is likely to use the shields to negate damage from Time Bomb, so it doesn't change the matchup much.</p>
						<p>The second nerf is to her ultimate where the "disable duration" from when you are knocked away is reduced to half of a second. This is a small nerf, but it means she won't be able to pin someone against a wall for as long.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kalista.png" alt="Kalista Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kalista Nerfs - Lower Attack Speed</p>
						<p>Kalista is losing several sources of attack speed, but is having them added to her Sentinal/Ghost. This means that optimally, Kalista has to deploy the ghost in combat in order to get the most of the skill.</p>
						<p>Another thing is that the cast range of her ultimate is reduced close to a max range of champion vision (1100 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/karma.png" alt="Karma Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Karma Buff - Bigger Empowered Shields</p>
						<p>Karma is getting a sizable buff to her AoE shield (R + E) for the team, with increased ratios and base shielding. This change is directed at mid to late game (she still maxes Q in lane, then shield), so she will be a bit more annoying.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lulu.png" alt="Lulu Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lulu Nerf - Shorter Speed Buffs</p>
						<p>Lulu's Whimsy on friendly targets (the massive movement speed increase) now has a maximum of 4 seconds at max ranks and a lower % movement speed based on AP.</p>
						<p>This means that Lulu mids won't be zipping around the map as often or as quickly.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Patch 6.5 (Mar 9 - Mar 23)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> Patch 6.5 is a smaller patch that doesn't have too much of an impact for Support Zilean, except for the two champions below.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw Change - Attack Speed Nerf</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw got his attack speed per level buffed, but removed the passive bonus from his W to compensate. This means that instead of having a massive amount of attack speed at 9 (when W was maxed), you have to continue leveling up to reach the point where it was before.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/soraka.png" alt="Soraka Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Soraka Change - Damage and Healing</p>
						<p>These changes have been in the works for some time now, and laning against Soraka before was frustrating. Now, her base heal is weaker and she is more reliant on landing her Starcall (Q) for self-sustain.</p>
						<p>With that being said, if Soraka lands her Starcall, her W heal will be even more powerful than previous patches. This means Soraka players should play more aggressively, instead of being a healbot. Soraka will likely win the trades, as the healing from her Q is really good.</p>
						<p>Personally, I like these changes and make her more dynamic to play with and against. But she is much harder to lane against now.</p>

			<!--h3>Patch 6.4 (Tentative PBE)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">PBE Updates</a></p-->
			<h3>Patch 6.4 (Feb 25 - Mar 9)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-64-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is a standard balance patch to tone down some of the strong abilities from former patches. This patch doesn't have much affecting Support Zilean.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ashe.png" alt="Ashe Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ashe buff - Q - Ranger's Focus duration</p>
					<p>Ashe got a minor buff to her Q (Ranger's Focus) for a longer duration. While Ashe still isn't popular, Zilean's speed buff does help Ashe take advantage of this buff.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/caitlyn.png" alt="Caitlyn Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Caitlyn buff - Yordle Snap Trap damage</p>
						<p>Caitlyn's trap is now going to be the go-to second skill maxed (or sometimes even being maxed first) and it packs a wallop. The damage was changed around from a flat % of damage to a base value + AD ratio, making her hit even harder with lower AD.</p>
						<p>This makes it crucial that your laner has the ability to push out enough so that you don't get zoned behind a line of traps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/ezreal.png" alt="Ezreal Icon">
					<p class="buff">Ezreal nerf - Trueshot Barrage cooldown</p>
					<p>This patch added an additional 50% extra cooldown on Ezreal's Ultimate, but still doesn't offer much in lowering the oppression that Ezreal has with the Iceborn Gauntlet build.</p>
					<p>Zilean is a horrible matchup with and against, so this nerf hopefully makes him less popular.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/jihn.png" alt="Jhin Icon">
					<p class="buff">Jhin buffs - Minor laning phase buffs</p>
					<p>Pairing Zilean with Jhin is one of the strongest combos that for Jhin. The buffs on this patch are minor and are more quality of life fixes rather than deliberate buffs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Kog'Maw nerf - Base attack speed</p>
					<p>Kog'Maw took a flat attack speed nerf, meaning that his early lane is even harder to farm up (and less overall attack speed throughout the game).</p>
					<p>Since pairing Zilean with and against Kog'Maw is favorable, this nerf is somewhat considerable, but Kog'Maw will still have the same build and playstyle, just with a slightly lower damage output.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/lucian.png" alt="Lucian Icon">
					<p class="buff">Lucian nerf - Culling range decrease</p>
					<p>Lucian is another rough matchup for Zilean, and any nerfs could impact his popularity. This is a pretty substantial decrease to his ultimate range, meaning that it's easier to escape (or puts him more at risk to chase further). It is still hard to Double Bomb him out of the Culling without getting ripped apart (900 range vs. 1200 range).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p class="buff">Tahm Kench nerf - Tongue Lash width decrease</p>
					<p>Tahm Kench has started to fall away from popularity, but is still strong. The difference now is that his Tongue Lash is harder to land (it's 10 units larger than a Mundo Cleaver).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Boots of Swiftness Icon">
					<p class="buff">Boots of Swiftness nerf - 5 Less Base Movespeed </p>
					<p>Boots of Swiftness are losing 5 base movement speed, bringing them to only 15 Movement Speed above the other boots.</p>
					<p>This is a considerable nerf, as Riot is trying to make Boots of Mobility a more appealing option for roamers, rather than having Swifties be the superior option in almost every circumstance.</p>
					<p>What does this mean for Zilean? Fewer Swifties, more potent slows. This is great because Swifties made Zilean's slows less effective, which increases the value of Zilean's kit.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/mercs64.png" alt="Mercury Treads Icon">
					<p class="nerf">Mercury's Treads buff - 30% Tencacity</p>
					<p>These boots became unpopular in Season 6 because of the reduced tenacity (from 35% to 20%), but now they are being increased back up to 30.</p>
					<p>On paper, this means that champions with Merc Treads will have lower duration slows and stuns, so this will impact Zilean negatively, but likely be helpful for your own team.</p>

			<h3>Patch 6.3 (Feb 10 - Feb 25)</h3>
			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-63-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This is one of the larger balance patchs as of late. There are many popular champions and items that are being toned down, and a few that are being buffed. Oh, and Duskblade.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/duskblade64.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Duskblade of Draktharr - Assassin Item</p>
					<p> This was the new assassin item introduced in patch 6.3, but it doesn't seem to be as overpowered as many believed it would be, thus it is not a super popular item.</p>
					<p>So Zilean has a leg up on most assassins normally because their burst is usually predictable and its just a matter of finding out when they are committing and hitting your ult.</p>
					<p>This makes Zilean's ult even easier to land in game because of the predictable burst is on a 2 second window (and the assassin leaving after it knows the execute is enough to finish the kill).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/alistar.png" alt="Alistar Icon">
					<p class="buff">Alistar nerf - Increased cooldown on Heal</p><p>Even though Zilean into Alistar is an easy matchup, taking the wind out of Alistar's healing (and the buff provided Windspeaker's Blessing).</p>
					<p>In general, Alistar is still strong, but his lane sustain was reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/corki.png" alt="Corki Icon">
					<p class="buff">Corki nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>Toning down the damage on Corki's Phosphorus Bomb (Q) and increasing the Missile Barrage (R) cooldown, this should make Corki a much less popular pick, but this is mostly directed to get him away from the mid lane.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/gragas.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p  class="buff">Gragas buffs - W Buff (AoE damage)</p><p>Gragas support is one of my favorite hidden gem supports, and now he's getting a buff (although I do not believe it was warranted). He was already pretty strong in the bottom lane as a Tank/CC support, but Zilean shouldn't have too many problems dealing with him.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/graves.png" alt="Graves Icon">
					<p class="buff">Graves nerf - Q Nerf</p><p>The nerf to the base damage of Grave's End of the Line (Q) is a much needed. Graves was strong in 3 positions (Top/Jungle/ADC), but hopefully this brings him back to only the bottom lane where he is easier to contain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/kogmaw.png" alt="Kog'Maw Icon">
					<p class="buff">Kog'Maw buffs - Attack speed change</p><p>By shifting the attack speed bonus from his Q to his W, maxing W on Kog'Maw becomes much more intuitive (rather than an attack speed vs. range tradeoff). Zilean can greatly help out Kog'Maw in lane, or make his life miserable if playing against.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/boots64.png" alt="Boots of Ionian Lucidity Icon"><img src="/img/items/swifties64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"><img src="/img/items/mobis64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p><span class="nerf">Tier 2 Boots changes - Price Up</p><p>These three sets of boots are being bumped up from 800g to 900g, which is a slight nerf, but nothing too impactful. This may actually be a blessing since the difference between Boots of Swiftness and other Teir 2 boots are only 200g. This may mean fewer Swifties in game, which is one item that puts a dent in how effective Zilean's slows can be.</p>

			<p><a href="//na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-62-notes" target="_blank">Full notes here</a></p>
			<p class="summary"><span>Summary:</span> This patch did some balancing on a few champions, along with the nerf to the popular Frost Queen's Claim. All in all, this was not a major patch.</p>
			<ul class="patch-container">
				<li>
					<img src="/img/masteries/cun312.png" alt="Thunderlord's Decree Icon">
					<p><span class="nerf">Thunderlord's Decree nerf - Variable cooldown</p><p>This is yet another change to Thunderlord's, which makes the talent even less useful for Support Zilean. Right now, there are very few worthwhile final mastery talents to take as Support Zilean. Here's my <a href="/basic-guides/mastery-breakdown/"> breakdown of the masteries.</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/items/spookies64.png" alt="Spooky Ghost Icon">
					<p class="buff">Frost Queen's Claim nerf - Longer cooldown, less slow</p><p>Since this should not be the item you go for, the increase in activation makes this much less appealing for non-supports, which means fewer Spookies in the game overall.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/tahmkench.png" alt="Tahm Kench Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Tahm Kench nerf</p><p>Tahm Kench took a big hit this patch to his damage and passive, but this may mean that he's going to be more prevalent in the bottom lane, in which case he will STILL be annoying at stopping all-ins.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/nunu.png" alt="Nunu Icon">
					<p><span class="neutral">Nunu changes - Snowball Buff</p><p>Nunu got a significant reduction in his snowball, but also lowered the damage. In the bottom lane, I expect him to see some play while players experiment with him, but I doubt he will be strong considering his base damage was lowered and his ratios reduced.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="/img/champion/shen.png" alt="Shen Icon">
					<p class="buff">Shen rework - Less Sustain</p><p>Shen was "reworked" this patch, and his abilities revolve around the positioning of his sword. Shen lost his ability to sustain his lane, but his taunt is unchanged, and he got a new dodge mechanic targeted around his sword that only dodges auto attacks. Shen in the bottom lane is weak, incredibly predictable and exploitable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div><img src="/img/items/grail64.png" alt="Grail Icon"><img src="/img/items/morello64.png" alt="Morello's Icon"></div>
					<p class="buff">Athene's Unholy Grail and Morellonomicon - Price Drop</p><p>Both of these items got a reduction in gold, making them more cost efficient and better buys if you decide to go more AP focused.</p>
